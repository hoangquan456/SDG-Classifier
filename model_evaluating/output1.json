    "title": "Obstructive lung disease and HIV/AIDS in the HAART era",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Early in the AIDS epidemic opportunistic lung infections, most notably Pneumocystis infection, dominated the clinical picture and were the most common cause of death in HIV-infected individuals. With the progressive development of effective antiretroviral treatments and prophylaxis against Pneumocystis, the prognosis in HIV/AIDS has improved dramatically with median survival now greater than a decade. However, lung infections from opportunistic, as well as typical bacterial pathogens remain a major cause of morbidity and are still the leading cause of death from HIV/AIDS. In addition, as the survival of infected individuals has increased, it is becoming apparent that other more-chronic lung diseases, including emphysema and cancer, are more common in these individuals. Although the mechanisms by which HIV/AIDS increases the risk of both infectious and noninfectious lung diseases are still being investigated, there is emerging evidence from clinical and experimental studies that HIV causes oxidant stress within the airways and that this may render the airway epithelium more susceptible to damage from environmental stresses, such as tobacco smoke. In parallel, there is intriguing evidence that colonization of the lower airways with Pneumocystis may promote chronic airway inflammation and destruction even when there is no clinical evidence of overt infection. Therefore, an important manifestation of HIV/AIDS, even in the HAART era, may be chronic oxidative stress and inflammation within the airways, rendering these individuals more susceptible to a wider range of lung diseases than previously seen early in the epidemic. This article focuses primarily on the emerging association between HIV/AIDS and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a clinical entity that includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis, and summarizes some of the recent clinical and experimental evidence that implicates HIV/AIDS in the HAART era as a potent risk factor for this common and disabling lung disease. .",

    "title": "Quad driving life-endangering fun? A medical and technical analysis Quad-Fahren ein lebensgef\u00e4hrlicher Spa\u00df? Eine medizinische und technische Unfallanalyse",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Aim: Quads or all-terrain vehicles do not seem to play a major role either in traffic accidents or in hospital admissions in Germany. However, reports about spectacular quad crashes in the press are not that infrequent. In contrast, no scientific survey or study regarding the issue of quad crashes in Germany has been published so far. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the present incidence of quad crashes, accident circumstances and resulting injury patterns, and to discuss possible consequences. Method: At a level I trauma centre, data from accident and hospital records of quad drivers were analysed focusing on the following parameters: injury type, localisation and mechanism, treatment details, abbreviated injury scale (AIS) score, maximum AIS (MAIS) score, delta-v, collision speed, and other technical parameters. Comparisons to motorcycle accidents were performed. Result During a five-year period from 2005 to 2009, there were ten admissions of quad drivers out of around 11000 emergency trauma patients (0.1%). Five accidents had happened off-road, four were traffic accidents. Eight patients were male; the mean age was 30 years. The mean total hospital stay was 15 days; there was a mean of 1.5 stays per patients with 2.0 surgical procedures needed. One patient died, only two recovered fully. The accident research data bank revealed 14 cases of quad accidents out of 18990 (0.1%). The mean impact velocity was 35km/h (motorcyclists 40.0km/h). The most frequent injury mechanism was a collision with a car. The upper extremity was the predominant injured region (AIS 0.7), while it was the lower extremity for motorcyclists (AIS0.91). The maximum AIS were 1.4 in quad drivers and 1.49 in motorcyclists. Conclusions: Although the absolute incidence of quad accidents in Germany is low, they pose a relatively high risk for severe injuries. Possible reasons are the comparatively low active and passive safety of quads as well as limited experience with quad driving and the fun aspect which might provoke risky driving behaviour. Larger series from the US report a high incidence of drug abuse among quad casualties as well as very limited use of helmets. In Germany, helmet usage has been mandatory since 2006. Possible additional measures to prevent a rise in quad accidents could be the total prohibition of alcohol consumption for quad drivers as well as special courses or driving licenses or an increase of the legal age for driving quads.

Although there is no uniform position or shared single outlook expressed in the articles in this special issue, there are some re-current tendencies that may have received less attention elsewhere in the world but clearly are in need of further investigation there as well. These tendencies are delicately intertwined and include: (1) a concern for democracy and participation minimally distorted by inevitable power imbalances; (2) a commitment to solidarity and preservation of the public good, including the outdoors; (3) a privileging of transactional and dialogical forms of meaning-making characterized by indeterminism and co-creation; (4) the need to reflect on and expose the, often-times, implicit normativity of education in general and of education for sustainable development in particular. It is suggested that these tendencies are quite crucial, but are also at odds with the increasing sense of urgency in dealing with sustainability challenges and a corresponding temptation to revert to instrumentalism. At the same time elevating these tendencies to norms or universal principles is internally inconsistent with the principles themselves. ",

    "title": "Evolution of monogamous marriage by maximization of inclusive fitness",
    "abstract_cleaned": "The majority of human societies allow polygynous marriage, and the prevalence of this practice is readily understood in evolutionary terms. Why some societies prescribe monogamous marriage is however not clear: current evolutionary explanations - that social monogamy increases within-group co-operation, giving societies an advantage in competition with other groups - conflict with the historical and ethnographic evidence. We show that, within the framework of inclusive fitness theory, monogamous marriage can be viewed as the outcome of the strategic behaviour of males and females in the allocation of resources to the next generation. Where resources are transferred across generations, social monogamy can be advantageous if partitioning of resources among the offspring of multiple wives causes a depletion of their fitness value, and/or if females grant husbands higher fidelity in exchange for exclusive investment of resources in their offspring. This may explain why monogamous marriage prevailed among the historical societies of Eurasia: here, intensive agriculture led to scarcity of land, with depletion in the value of estates through partitioning among multiple heirs. Norms promoting high paternity were common among ancient societies in the region, and may have further facilitated the establishment of social monogamy. In line with the historical and ethnographic evidence, this suggests that monogamous marriage emerged in Eurasia following the adoption of intensive agriculture, as ownership of land became critical to productive and reproductive success.

    "abstract_cleaned": "This article discusses Helen Safa's analyses of the impact of development strategies and social policies on gender relations and women headed families in the Caribbean and Puerto Rico. The discussion focuses on findings of a research project regarding patterns of women's employment, autonomy, marital relations, family headship and poverty in Puerto Rico in the decade beginning in the year 2000, using excerpts from interviews conducted with women workers displaced from a clothing and a tuna factory between 2001 and 2002 (Col\u00f3n et al. 2008), as well as data from the Public Use Sample (PUMS) of the U.S. Census Puerto Rico Community Survey 2005-2007. It is argued that women's employment has resulted in advances in women's autonomy, gender equity, and renegotiations of the provider role, but, intensified by men's unstable earnings, it has also led to the increase of female family headship even among married women. Women's education and employment have been an important means of reducing family poverty both among dual earner families and female heads. Yet, the continuing joblessness in the Island places even higher educated sectors on the verge of economic precariousness.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "End-plates are highly stiff plates that hold together the components composing a fuel cell stack, i.e. Membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEAs), Gas Distribution Layers (GDLs) and bipolar plates, offering sufficient contact pressure between them. The proper contact pressure is required not only to improve energy efficiency of a stack by decreasing ohmic loss but also to prevent leakage of fluids such as hydrogen, air, or coolant. When a fuel cell starts in cold environment, heat generated in a fuel cell stack as a result of electrochemical reactions should not be used much to increase the temperature of endplates but to melt ice inside the stack to prevent ice-blocking and to increase the temperature near the three-phase-boundary on MEAs. However, to satisfy the high stiffness required, massive metallic endplates have been used despite their inferior thermal characteristics: high thermal conductivity and large thermal inertia. These metallic endplates may deteriorate the cold-start characteristics of a fuel cell stack. However, fiber reinforced composite materials have high potential for the bipolar plate applications due to their high stiffness and good thermal properties. In this work, composite sandwich endplates were developed through Axiomatic Design procedure in which a design matrix was established with their functional requirements and design parameters. In addition, their effects on the cold start characteristics of a fuel cell stack were investigated analytically and experimentally as well. Copyright ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Severe droughts in southern Africa are associated with livelihood impacts, a strain on local economies, and other hardships. Extensive effort has been spent in the past trying to improve responses to periods of extensive drought. There have also been renewed calls for improvements to climate change adaptation by adopting more proactive governance and disaster risk reduction approaches. Few efforts, however, have been made to assess how to learn more from past drought efforts so as to enhance overall resilience to future drought risks. Few have examined the role and contributions of institutions and drought governance, either across spatial scales [from regional (i.e., Southern African Development Community) to national scales (e.g., South Africa) to the very local scale (e.g., Limpopo Province, South Africa)] or across temporal scales (over at least 100 yr). Despite calls for better risk management approaches at all levels, this paper illustrates two points. First, a failure to fully understand, integrate, and learn from past efforts may undermine current and future drought response. Second, state-led drought risk reduction, which remains focused on a financial bail-out mentality, with little follow-through on proactive rather than reactive drought responses, is also seriously contributing to the vulnerability of the region to future drought impacts.

    "abstract_cleaned": "The biodiversity of hard-bottom substrata comprises species growing on exposed rock and in hidden microhabitats, such as cracks and crevices. This study examines the succession of epibenthic organisms colonizing an artificial substratum with one surface exposed and one surface hidden on a vertical wall off northern Chile. On each sampling date species coverage of three replicate panels on both surfaces was assessed. The hidden surface was dominated in terms of coverage by the bryozoans Membranipora isabelleana and Lagenicella variabilis, while algae were absent. In contrast, the exposed surface was dominated by encrusting red corallines and the red alga Rhodymenia corallina. At the end of the experimental period both surfaces were dominated by colonial suspension feeders, but showed a different community structure and successional pattern. On the exposed surface, competitive exclusion was identified as an important aspect of succession, whereas on the hidden surface this pattern was not observed. These findings have implications for overall biodiversity, because pioneer species that are not able to survive long periods on exposed surfaces become restricted to hidden surfaces, from where they spread laterally. Thus, hidden microhabitats provide refuges for certain species, and may play an important role in the overall succession on rock faces. We conclude that examination of hidden microhabitats is necessary in order to fully understand succession in hard-bottom habitats.",

Determination was performed in algae, potential environmental bio-monitor matrices, using 0.1 M HClO4 as supporting electrolyte. The sample digestion was also performed using a concentrated HCl-HNO3-H2SO4 acidic attack mixture. The analytical procedure was validated by the analysis of standard reference materials: Lagarosiphon Major (Aquatic Plant) BCR-CRM 060, Ulva Lactuca BCR-CRM 279 and Platihypnidium Riparioides BCR-CRM 061. For all elements in the certified matrices, in terms of repeatability, expressed as relative standard deviation (sr), precision was on order of 3-5%. In all cases, accuracy, expressed as relative error (e) was less than 6%, while the detection limits expressed in \u03bcg/g, dry weight, were in the 0.031-0.085 range. The analytical procedure was transferred and applied to algae, species Ulva Rigida and Gracilaria Rhodophita, sampled in two lagoon ecosystems connected to the Adriatic Sea (Italy): the Goro Bay, located at the mouth of the Po River, and the lagoon ecosystem located in proximity to Ravenna. To better validate the proposed method, a critical comparison with spectroscopic measurements is also discussed. .",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Early Pleistocene (Santernian: MNN 19b-c Nannofossil Zones) coastal marine deposits related to rocky coast evolution have been described in a wide area near Orvieto (Umbria, Central Italy). Sediments range from boulders and blocks, to rounded pebbles and cobbles, to sands, silts and clays. Sedimentological analysis enables description of five main facies associations leading to identification of sea-cliff toe, beachface, upper and lower shoreface and offshore environments. The succession documents regressive-transgressive cycles. Lateral facies variations due to the paleocoast morphology have also been noted, and some sedimentation models are here proposed. The rocky coast evolution can be interpreted in relation to a \u00abcliff cycle\u00bb: during transgressions, the cliff is directly exposed to wave energy and production of boulders and blocks is promoted, as well as the reworking and deposition of rounded to flattened cobbles and pebbles on the beachface. At the same time, a seaward sandy sedimentation takes place. Regressive phases, and cliff erosion itself, cause the seaward shift of coastal systems, until the cliff becomes confined to the backshore. During sea-level falls, only reworking of previous deposits can occur. This model is suitable for high energy zones near promontories, but seems inadequate to explain sedimentation on lower energy zones (e.g.: embayments), where other factors, as coastal slope and bay's size, play a key role in determinate facies distribution. The main differences in facies organization occur during regression, and specific sedimentation models are proposed. Protected areas behind the promontories show a thin fringe of cliff talus and \u00abcoarse clastic beachface\u00bb and a wider sand/calcarenitic shoreface. During transgression, facies pattern resemble the high energy zones, with a gravel beachface here broader than cliff talus and a sharper transition to the shoreface. During regression, both beachface gravel and upper shoreface clinostratified sand shift seaward, above the sub-horizontal lower shoreface facies. Sheltered bays with gravel beaches, organized on shore-parallel \u00abfacies belts\u00bb, locally occur. The upper beachface may here persist longer during regression, and better organization occurs in the swash zone and foreshore, represented by alternations of \u00ab imbricate\u00bb and \u00abinfill\u00bb zones, and \u00abinfill\u00bb and \u00abouter frame\u00bb zones respectively. Conversely, during transgression the \u00abimbricate\u00bb zone is also replaced by a \u00abcoarse clastic beachface\u00bb. During both transgressive and regressive phases, offshore silty clay sedimentation shows no modification.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Within the last few years, Tanzania has witnessed mushrooming growth of wildlife management areas (WMAs). These are broadly meant to halt (or reduce) loss of wildlife populations, and ensure that local people benefit from their conservation. However, human pressure is rapidly increasing and causing management problems in the WMAs. Some human land-use activities also limit wildlife dispersal, potentially destabilizing wildlife population dynamics. In addition, poor resource use diversification and lack of creativity constrain sustainable use of natural resources in the WMAs; consequently, their contribution to sustainable livelihoods is seriously undermined. A key question is how WMAs can be a sustainable and competitive land-use option that meets their predetermined objectives? Without doubt, a road map to sustainable WMAs should responsibly engage the government, non-governmental organizations, and community-based organizations in a joint effort towards realization of simple and flexible WMAs establishment process, quality wildlife habitat, and reduced human pressure on the wildlife resources, as well as successful and sustainable wildlife-based enterprises.

    "abstract_cleaned": "The intensification of crop management in the U.K. over the past 60 years has resulted in the decline of the populations of a number of annual plant species adapted to arable habitats. In contrast, other species continue to be common as arable weeds. A community assembly approach was taken to explain these recent changes in the weed flora using databases of plant functional traits, a pot experiment, and weed surveys of the Broadbalk long-term experiment. The hypothesis was tested that species that have been selected against by increased fertilizer inputs and herbicide use share an adverse combination of traits. An analysis comparing the combination of maximum height, seed weight, and time of first flowering of 29 common and 32 rare or threatened U.K. autumn weeds established that rare or threatened species occupied an area of trait space that was distinct from the common species. A rare weed trait syndrome of short stature, large seed, and late flowering was identified. The theory that species with a trait syndrome that is currently unfavorable are better adapted for less fertile environments was supported by the pot experiment. Species with a combination of short stature and large seed had a relatively greater competitive ability in low compared to high fertility treatments. Analysis of survey data from the Broadbalk long-term experiment confirmed that, as N inputs increased, the abundance of the two functional groups that contained only common species remained stable or increased; whereas, the groups dominated by rare or threatened species declined as fertility increased. An understanding of the response traits of arableplants to management filters, including fertilizer inputs and herbicide, is valuable for designing conservation strategies for rare species or predicting future shifts in the functional diversity of weed communities including the potential for invasive species to establish.

    "title": "Effects of diameter-limit by-laws on forestry practices, economics, and regional wood supply for private woodlands in southwestern Ontario",
    "abstract_cleaned": "The agriculturally dominated Counties of Huron and Perth in southwestern Ontario regulate forest harvesting on private land through diameter-limit-based tree conservation by-laws. The rates of harvesting, along with the volume and value of timber sales and the type and quantity of tree marking were examined for the years 1997 to 1999. Although these harvests may form an important part of periodic farm income, at only 13% forest cover, these landscapes may be further degraded by unsustainable forest harvesting practices. Based on the three study years, the mean annual area of forest harvested was found to be 4.4% of the total private forest landbase. The mean volume harvested from upland and lowland deciduous forest was 4666 and 6148 fbm/ha, respectively. Over-harvesting under a diameter-limit or hybrid method occurred in 8% of woodlot area with removal rates in excess of 10 000 fbm/ha. The most severe over-harvesting disproportionately targeted lowland woodlots, possibly compromising the ecological health of these often sensitive areas. Sugar maple, red/silver maple and ash were most commonly harvested at 33%, 31% and 21% of total species volume, respectively.On average, for standing timber, landowners received $680/Mfbm in the upland hardwood forests and $281/Mfbm in the lowland hardwood forests. On an area basis, mean price paid was $3680/ha and $1956/ha respectively on upland and lowland forests. Only 8% of the private land was harvested using single-tree selection or stand improvement (92% harvest was diameter-limit or a hybrid of same). Using a simple model, we found that woodlot owners comprising at least 74% of private woodland area would need to participate in forest harvesting in order to maintain the 1997 to 1999 partial harvest area rate of 2349 ha/yr. This rate may not be sustainable, given poor forest conditions in some areas, past management practices and a reduction in landowners interested in forest harvesting. Improvements are needed to bring the level of good forestry practice up by 62% to meet the rates that were being performed under pre-1994, free, provincial government private land forestry programs.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "This article argues that a shift towards issues of poverty is a welcome antidote to policy\u2010making that had expunged poverty from the central agenda to focus on stabilization, debt management and static allocative efficiency. Unfortunately, in correcting a narrow policy agenda the new focus pushes a good point too far when it focuses attention only on the proximate causes of poverty and narrows the development agenda. Development was aimed at more than poverty and, significantly in countries that have successfully combated poverty, the most important policy measures were not explicitly directed at poverty. Indeed in many cases, other objectives \u2014 pre\u2010empting social unrest, nation\u2010building, \u2018human capital\u2019 developmental considerations \u2014 lay behind the policies that, ex post, can be read as poverty reducing. Eradication of poverty is always embedded in social and economic development. The determinants of human development goals are multiple and cut across sectors. The new challenge in Africa is to bring back development, but now one that is democratically anchored and socially inclusive.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "A data analysis method is proposed to cluster and explore spatio-temporal characteristics of the 22 years of precipitation data (1982-2003) for Taiwan. The wavelet transform self-organizing map (WTSOM) framework combines the wavelet transform (WT) and a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network. WT is used to extract dynamic and multiscale features of the non-stationary precipitation time-series, and SOM is applied to objectively identify spatially homogeneous clusters on the high-dimensional wavelet-transformed feature space. Haar and Morlet wavelets are applied in the data preprocessing stage to preserve the desired characteristics of the precipitation data. A two-level SOM neural network is applied to identify clusters in the wavelet space in the clustering stage. The performance of clustering is evaluated using silhouette coefficients. The results indicate that singularities or sharp transitions are more significant than changes in the periodicity or data structure in the spatial-temporal precipitation data. The WTSOM results show that six clusters are optimal for both Haar and Morlet wavelet functions, but their corresponding geographic locations are different. The geographic locations of clusters based on the Haar wavelet, which captures the occurrence of extreme hydrological events, appear in blocks while those classified by the Morlet wavelet, which indicates periodicity changes and describes fine structures, appear in strips that cross the island of Taiwan. Principal component analysis is applied to the precipitation data of each cluster. The first principal components explain 62-90% of the total variation of data. Characteristics of precipitation data for each cluster are explored using scalogram analysis. The results show that both extreme hydrological events and periodicity changes appear in the spatial and temporal precipitation data but with different characteristics for each cluster. Recognizing homogeneous hydrologic regions and identifying the associated precipitation characteristics improves the efficiency of water resources management in adapting to climate change, preventing the degradation of the water environment, and reducing the impact of climate-induced disasters. Measures for countering the stress of precipitation variation for water resources management are provided. . All rights reserved.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Not only in the Netherlands, but also elsewhere, there is stalemate between modern and postmodern/post-structural planning, or alternatively, between state-controlled and neo-liberal planning. Since the 1980s at least, modernist, state-controlled planning has been fundamentally debunked as a highly regulatory and prescriptive operation, resulting in syrupy planning processes, which are very costly, inflexible and inefficient, and suppressing all new and creative initiatives that do not fit within the set framework. Postmodern and post-structural alternatives developed since then have been very effective in counter-attacking the alleged virtues of that planning strategy, but less fruitful at promoting effective and/or sustainable practices. The article assumes that this is related to the fact that time and again these alternatives continue to be formulated from within the existing planning framework, from a specific governmental, or at least a government influenced, view of planning: in essence from the inside-out. From this position, the article goes on to describe the possible outlines for a practical outside-inward, actor-relational-approach. It has been developed from experimental case studies in concrete planning practices, for example, a case study in Southern Limburg in the Netherlands. Concurrently, it has also been derived from a fundamental interaction with behavioural, urban regime and actor-network/network actor theories, with an extensive evaluation of the latter. The article concludes with a call for a new fundamental, but proactive, reassembling of spatial planning in an actor-oriented, as opposed to a government-oriented, way. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "In Chinese cities, air pollution has become a serious and aggravating environmental problem undermining the sustainability of urban ecosystems and the quality of urban life. Bulk atmospheric deposition samples were collected two-weekly, from February 2007 to January 2008, at three representative areas, one suburban and two urbanized, in the subtropical city, Guangzhou, China, to assess the deposition fluxes and seasonal variations of phthalate esters (PAEs). Sixteen PAE congeners in bulk deposition samples were measured and the depositional fluxes of \u221116PAEs ranged from 3.41 to 190 \u03bcg m-2 day-1, and were highly affected by local anthropogenic activities. The significant relationship between PAEs and particulate depositional fluxes (correlation coefficient R2 = 0.72, P < 0.001) showed PAEs are associated primarily with particles. Temporal flux variations of PAEs were influenced by seasonal changes in meteorological parameters, and the deposition fluxes of PAEs were obviously higher in wet season than in dry season. Diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), Di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), and Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) dominated the PAE pattern in bulk depositions, which is consistent with a high consumption of the plasticizer market in China. PAE profiles in bulk deposition showed similarities exhibited in both time and space, and a weak increase of high molecular weight PAE (HMW PAE) contribution in the wet season compared to those in the dry season. Average atmospheric deposition fluxes of PAEs in the present study were significantly higher than those from other studies, reflecting strong anthropogenic inputs as a consequence of rapid industrial and urban development in the region. .

Tabarzeh] under in vivo conditions. Results showed that essential oils especially thyme, fennel and summer savory oils had a high inhibitory effect on mycelial growth of B. cinerea. Under in vivo assays, thyme and summer savory oils were able to reduce fungal decay sensory on table grape after 60 days of storage. In addition, essential oils had significant efficacy on quality parameters of fruit reducing a weight loss, berry shrinkage and berry and rachis browning. Also essential oil treatment increased the maturity index levels in treated fruits in comparison with controls. GC/MS analysis showed that linalool (65.25%), trans-anethole (64.72%), carvacrol (54.14%) and \u03b2-ocimene (12.62%) were the main compounds identified in sweet basil, fennel, summer savory and thyme oils, respectively.

Levels of the sum of PAH analytes were significantly higher in the sediments of commercial ponds compared to that of reference, golf course, low-density residential, and high-density residential ponds. Isomer ratio analysis suggested that the predominant source of PAHs were pyrogenic; however, many ponds had a PAH signature consistent with mixed uncombusted and combusted PAH sources. PAH levels in these sediments could be modeled using both pond drainage area and pond surface area. These results demonstrate that the sediment from most commercial ponds, and a few residential and golf course ponds, were moderately contaminated with PAHs. PAH levels in these contaminated ponds exceeded between 42% and 75% of the ecological screening values for individual PAH analytes established by US EPA Region IV, suggesting that they may pose a toxicological risk to wildlife.

Factor structure and inter-item correlations of the PHQ-9 are examined, along with associations between depression and culture-bound syndromes, self-esteem, self-efficacy, acculturation stress, and other sample psychosocial characteristics. The PHQ-9 exhibited strong factor loadings and internal consistency, and its severity score significantly correlated with other indicators of health status that were observed in previous studies to be significantly associated with depression. The PHQ-9 appears to be culturally relevant for use with Mexicans coming from a variety of indigenous cultures and having very low education and literacy. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Silvopastoral systems (SPS) have been suggested as an approach to reduce pasture degradation and, consequently, reduce the deforestation of new areas in the Brazilian cerrado (savanna). This study assessed the contribution of trees to soil fertility in a silvopastoral system in Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, 19\u00b0 35\u2032 36\u2033 S, 43\u00b0 51\u2032 56\u2033 W; altitude 747 m. The SPS has developed since 1984, through the use of natural regeneration of the native species Zeyheria tuberculosa Vell. Bur., with a density of 160 trees ha-1. The forage component of the system was Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu. The control treatment was a pasture adjacent to SPS with the same forage but without the influence of trees. In 2005, the litterfall of trees (leaves, fruits, and stems) was collected monthly, and the dry matter yield and nutrient content were measured. Soil profile samples were collected in February 2006. The litterfall of trees represented considerable inputs of nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca2+). In the soil, organic matter (OM) and K reduced with depth. At this planting density, this tree species contributed mainly to amelioration of soil acidity, in the 0-2 cm layer and/or in the profile as a whole. In contrast, there were no significant differences in N, P, and K content of the control and SPS soil. This can be related to the high C/N and lignin/N ratios of the litter inputs. Agroforestry systems are complex and the site specific interactions among the components (tree, forage, and animal) must be understood to develop locally adapted systems and optimize productive efficiency. Consequently simple prescriptions for the implementation of SPS by land managers are unlikely. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Soil erosion is a key factor in Mediterranean environments, and is not only closely related to geoecological factors (lithology, topography, and climatology) but also to land-use and plant cover changes. The long history of human activity in Spain explains the development of erosion landscapes and sedimentary structures (recent alluvial plains, alluvial fans, deltas and flat valleys infilled of sediment). For example, the expansion of cereal agriculture and transhumant livestock between the 16th and 19th centuries resulted in episodes of extensive soil erosion. During the 20th century farmland abandonment prevailed in mountain areas, resulting in a reduction of soil erosion due to vegetation recolonization whereas sheet-wash erosion, piping and gullying affected abandoned fields in semi-arid environments. The EU Agrarian Policy and the strengthening of national and international markets encouraged the expansion of almond and olive orchards into marginal lands, including steep, stony hill slopes. Vineyards also expanded to steep slopes, sometimes on new unstable bench terraces, thus leading to increased soil erosion particularly during intense rainstorms. The expansion of irrigated areas, partially on salty and poorly structured soils, resulted in piping development and salinization of effluents and the fluvial network. The trend towards larger fields and farms in both dry farming and irrigated systems has resulted in a relaxation of soil conservation practices.  All rights reserved.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Objective: A strong relation between negative affect and craving has been demonstrated in laboratory and clinical studies, with depressive symptomatology showing particularly strong links to craving and substance abuse relapse. Mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP), shown to be efficacious for reduction of substance use, uses mindfulness-based practices to teach alternative responses to emotional discomfort and lessen the conditioned response of craving in the presence of depressive symptoms. The goal in the current study was to examine the relation between measures of depressive symptoms, craving, and substance use following MBRP. Method: Individuals with substance use disorders (N = 168; mean age 40.45 years, SD = 10.28; 36.3% female; 46.4% non-White) were recruited after intensive stabilization, then randomly assigned to either 8 weekly sessions of MBRP or a treatment-as-usual control group. Approximately 73% of the sample was retained at the final 4-month follow-up assessment. Results: Results confirmed a moderated-mediation effect, whereby craving mediated the relation between depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory) and substance use (Timeline Follow-Back) among the treatment-as-usual group but not among MBRP participants. MBRP attenuated the relation between postintervention depressive symptoms and craving (Penn Alcohol Craving Scale) 2 months following the intervention (f2 = .21). This moderation effect predicted substance use 4 months following the intervention (f2 = .18). Conclusion: MBRP appears to influence cognitive and behavioral responses to depressive symptoms, partially explaining reductions in postintervention substance use among the MBRP group. Although results are preliminary, the current study provides evidence for the value of incorporating mindfulness practice into substance abuse treatment and identifies a potential mechanism of change following MBRP.

    "abstract_cleaned": "This article addresses the feasibility of commercial biodiesel production in Jordan as an alternative fuel source. The study suggests that the most effective method of producing biodiesel in a country like Jordan could be based on large-scale microalgae cultivation. Since many strains of microalgae exist, it would first be necessary to identify the species most appropriate for growth in the Jordanian climate, and, second, to develop an affordable cultivation media based on locally-available ingredients. Because of the tremendous positive impact the success of this project would have on the local and national economy, the Jordanian government should also consider the establishment an algae biotechnology research center focusing on production of recombinant algal strains that grow rapidly and yield greater amounts of lipids. The southern part of Jordan, near Aqaba, provides a warm climate year-round, plentiful sea water, and a wealth of naturally-available minerals for enrichment of the cultivation media. A suitable bioreactor design is necessary for the continuous cultivation of the algae; the bioreactor should be coupled with a chemical/biochemical reaction stage for the large-scale transesterification required for conversion of the oil into biodiesel. Finally, it would also be advantageous to set up a carbon-neutral biodiesel-based electric generation power plant close by to supply power to neighboring cities while carbon emissions serve as a source of CO2 for the microalgal production cycle. Microalgae-derived biodiesel would serve as a renewable and nearly carbon-neutral source of energy. This paper addresses the key steps in the production cycle that would optimize the oil yield and biodiesel production capacity from microalgae.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Patients with diabetes who experience low-health literacy often struggle in their roles as health consumers. A multi-disciplinary group of educators and researchers collaborated to develop a video intervention to help these patients better understand their disease and communicate more effectively with their physician. We describe the assessment study and report preliminary patient perception outcome data regarding the utility of the videos as a communication and health education intervention. Generally, the participants found the intervention to be helpful and informative. For many, the intervention led them to consider behavior changes. For others, the intervention was a prompt for diabetes-related conversations with their physicians. Participant responses also provided empirical support that the intervention was consistent with key principles of message design for patients with low-health literacy. ",

Despite its parsimony, the limited participation model developed in this paper improves over the standard model in terms of explaining two important features of business cycle facts of developing countries: high volatility of consumption, and high negative correlation between the trade balance and output. Limited participation model is then used to inspect the effects of financial development and integration on macroeconomic volatility. Under a standard calibration, limited participation model leads to the conclusion that financial development and integration are associated with higher investment and output volatility. Effect of more participation on consumption volatility is dependent on the specification of the risk premium function. ",

The concentration of the formed BF4- increased with decreasing pH, raising the total fluoride concentration and lowering the total aluminum ion concentration. Once formed, BF4- was stable under neutral and alkaline conditions. Fluoride in the form of BF4- was converted to fluoroaluminate ions by adding an aluminum compound under acidic conditions. A method for removing fluoride in the form of BF4- is proposed whereby fluoroaluminate ions formed by the reaction of BF4- with aluminum are decomposed with calcium ions. This process was applied to the treatment of wastewater from flue gas desulfurization plants, and resulted in a satisfying level of reduction in the range of the fluoride emission limit of 8 mg/l. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Aims: This study aims to investigate the ecology of coliphages, an important microbial pollution indicator. Specifically, our experiments address (i) the ability of environmental Escherichia coli (E. coli) to serve as hosts for coliphage replication, and (ii) the temporal and spatial distribution of coliphages in coastal waters. Methods and Results: Water samples from three locations in California's Newport Bay watershed were tested for the presence of coliphages every 2 weeks for an entire year. A total of nine E. coli strains isolated from various sources served as hosts for coliphage detection. Coliphage occurrence was significantly different between freshwater, estuarine and coastal locations and correlated with water temperature, salinity and rainfall in the watershed. The coliphages isolated on the environmental hosts had a broad host-range relative to the coliphages isolated on an E. coli strain from sewage and a US EPA recommended strain for coliphage detection. Conclusions: Coliphage occurrence was related to the temperature, rainfall and salinity within the bay. The adaptation to a broad host-range may enable the proliferation of coliphages in the aquatic environment. Significance and Impact of the Study: Understanding the seasonal variation of phages is useful for establishing a background level of coliphage presence in coastal waters. The broad host-range of coliphages isolated on the environmental E. coli host calls for investigation of coliphage replication in the aquatic environment. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Violent conflict and humanitarian disasters such as floods, famines, or tsunamis, have existed since the start of human history. However, it is only recently that education in these emergency situations has emerged as a visible organizational field. We aim to use a unique theoretical application of sociological neoinstitutionalism to explain the rapid and recent rise of emergency education as a professional field, focusing specifically on the creation of global standards called the INEE Minimum Standards for Education in Emergencies, Chronic Crises and Early Reconstruction. We argue that international standards in emergency education arise due to the institutionalization of education as a human right and rationalization of approaches to solving social problems. A key implication of our argument is that decoupling between formal standards and on-the-ground practice is likely to be endemic, lessening the day-to-day utility of the standards. However, the creation of international standards and an organizational field of emergency education professionals may provide long-term benefits by contributing to the redefinition of humanitarian intervention to include education.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Rapid urbanisation and industrialisation have resulted in sharp land cover changes. Urban change not only impacts on land cover but also on urban climate. Land surface and atmospheric modifications due to urbanisation generally lead to a modified thermal climate that is warmer than the surrounding, non-urbanised areas. In this research remote sensing technology was used to evaluate urban growth patterns and its thermal characteristics through mapping impervious surfaces and evaluating thermal infrared images. The case study was carried out in the northern part of Ho Chi Minh City, which has experienced accelerated urban development since the late 1980s. Landsat and Aster images were used to calculate variations in urban impervious surfaces from 1989 to 2006. Thermal bands were processed to obtain radiant surface temperatures for investigating the urban heat island effect associated with increasing impervious surfaces, both spatially and temporally. Impacts of urban development on surface temperature were shown by investigating the surface urban heat island effect intensity. The results show that the built-up area in the northern part of Ho Chi Minh City expanded by 6.5 times between 1989 and 2006. Urban development has altered the magnitude and pattern of the surface urban heat island, with the highest land surface temperature cores found in the industrial (greater than 45oC) and urban areas (within 36oC and 40oC). In suburban and rural areas, where agricultural land still remains with full vegetation cover, the land surface temperature is usually lower. Using remote sensing, the impervious surface was extracted with overall accuracy and a Kappa coefficient for all three years greater than 96%, and the retrieved land surface temperatures with variations from in-situ measurements of less than 2oC. The results presented here indicate that remote sensing can help to spatially monitor urban development and land surface temperature changes over the whole area and over a long period of time.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Purpose \u2013 Any attempt to improve housing quality goes concurrently with improvement of income level and with economic development. The purpose of this paper is to assess the viability of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in financing housing improvement for the urban poor. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 In order to understand in great depth the viability of MFIs in housing finance for the urban poor in Tanzania, the case study strategy was applied, with five sub\ue4f8cases, which form the smallest unit of analysis. Findings \u2013 Most housing financing initiatives carried out by governments and large financial institutions often end up benefiting the high/middle income segment. Administrative procedures, terms and conditions set up by the government and banking institutions exclude the poor due to their low affordability levels. As the poor cannot meet the set stringent conditions; the MFIs that are growing in numbers in Tanzania and other developing countries have been their alternative strategy for housing finance. Research limitations/implications \u2013 Close linkage exists between the housing loans, housing improvement and poverty alleviation among the urban poor in informal housing settlement. Practical implications \u2013 WAT\ue4f8SACCOS, a housing MFI, has devised a repayment schedule, which is viable, compatible and affordable for the poor. These types of institutions can be used as intermediaries between large financial institutions, including commercial banks and the poor, to make it easier for the latter to access housing loans. Public\ue4f8private and popular partnerships facilitate the availability of financial services for the urban poor. Originality/value \u2013 The paper adds to the literature in that, whilst housing issues should continue to be at the top of development and political agenda, housing MFI assists in ensuring that the poor get access to housing, which is regarded as a poverty reduction asset. \u00a9 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",

But the means of suspended material(SS), chemical oxygen demand(COD), biological control oxygen demand(BOD), total inorganic nitrogen(TIN), total inorganic phosphate(TIP), Oils, Zn, et al. are on the contrary, and among the monitoring pollutant values (e.g. DO, COD, TIN, TIP, Oils, Hg, et al. ) are greater than the Class 2 sea-water specified by the Chinese National Standard of Sea Water Quality. Compared with the monitoring pollutant values in the Pinqing Lagoon, the order of pollution is S10>S12>S4. The E index and NQI index indicate that the sea area of S10, S12, and S4 is eutrophicated. The results show that the water quality in Pinqing Lagoon is badly affected by domestic sewerage, industrial waste water, mariculture pollution, and so on. The government of Shanwei, having realized the adverse impacts of pollution in the lagoon on the physical and economic environment of Shanwei, is implementing measures to restore the lagoon to its natural ecology.

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a quantitative survey design. Findings: The findings indicate that the basic scientific and technological skills of reading critically and writing persuasively as well as accessing and using information efficiently have been achieved to a great extent in the context of the study; whereas, mathematical and scientific skills and global awareness and cross-cultural issues still need more attention. Variations in the level of mastery as well as gender differences in the achievement of certain skills clusters were also identified and discussed in light of the robustness of the theory of the universal digital native. Research limitations/implications: The results cannot be generalized into other contexts and the data were basically self-reported and not corroborated by evidence from triangulated sources. Practical implications: Effective dealing with the basic and technological skills should be continued; however, more attention should be given to the development of the skills in mathematics and the sciences. Likewise, the visual-literacy skills and the levels of global awareness and cross-cultural understanding and appreciation should be improved. Originality/value: This exploratory study fills a knowledge gap and may set the stage for further research into the extent to which the twenty-first century skills are being realized by institutions of higher learning given the scarcity or non-existence of this research.

Here we introduce a system that makes it possible to recover alkalinity in an extra recovery compartment. The system consisted of this extra compartment which was located between anode and cathode compartment. The compartment was separated from the anode by a cation exchange membrane and from the cathode by an anion exchange membrane, which made clean hydrogen production possible. To compensate for the charge movement as a result of the flow of electrons, both cations and hydroxyl ions moved into the new recovery compartment. When a synthetic waste stream was fed through this recovery compartment, both pH and conductivity increased. When this stream is then fed to the anode of the BES, no additional buffer was required to produce the same current (3.5 A/m2) at an applied voltage of 1 V. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The evident correlation of climate impacts and poverty poses a particular challenge for the Southern African region: climatically, the region is warming up faster than the rest of the world, and socio-economically it is one of the world's poorest and most vulnerable regions. With its land and water resources already under stress, the double bind of climatic change and structural poverty will create impenetrable boundaries for sustainable human development unless unprecedented adaptive capacities are developed. This introduction provides a conceptual and environmental background for empirically informed discussions of adaptation to climate change in Southern Africa. It first considers the notion of boundaries for human development and relates them to established concepts of vulnerability and adaptation. It then reviews expected climate impacts in the context of regional development and provides an outlook on the research presented in this special issue. It thus sets the stage for exploring the potential of Southern Africa to follow a sustainable human development path while responding to the impacts of climate change. In conclusion we argue that, uncertainty in regional climate scenarios notwithstanding, the reduction of people's vulnerability is imperative for development policies across the Southern African region.

    "abstract_cleaned": "River flow and quality data, including chlorophyll-a as a surrogate for river phytoplankton biomass, were collated for the River Ouse catchment in NE England, which according to established criteria is a largely unpolluted network. Against these data, a daily river quality model (QUESTOR) was setup and successfully tested. Following a review, a river quality classification scheme based on phytoplankton biomass was proposed. Based on climate change predictions the model indicated that a shift from present day oligotrophic/mesotrophic conditions to a mesotrophic/eutrophic system could occur by 2080. Management options were evaluated to mitigate against this predicted decline in quality. Reducing nutrient pollution was found to be less effective at suppressing phytoplankton growth than the less costly option of establishing riparian shading. In the Swale tributary, ongoing efforts to reduce phosphorus loads in sewage treatment works will only reduce peak (95th percentile) phytoplankton by 11%, whereas a reduction of 44% is possible if riparian tree cover is also implemented. Likewise, in the Ure, whilst reducing nitrate loads by curtailing agriculture in the headwaters may bring about a 10% reduction, riparian shading would instead reduce levels by 47%. Such modelling studies are somewhat limited by insufficient field data but offer a potentially very valuable tool to assess the most cost-effective methods of tackling effects of eutrophication. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "To gauge the current commitment to scientific research in the United States of America (US), we compared federal research funding (FRF) with the US gross domestic product (GDP) and industry research spending during the past six decades. In order to address the recent globalization of scientific research, we also focused on four key indicators of research activities: research and development (R&D) funding, total science and engineering doctoral degrees, patents, and scientific publications. We compared these indicators across three major population and economic regions: the US, the European Union (EU) and the People's Republic of China (China) over the past decade. We discovered a number of interesting trends with direct relevance for science policy. The level of US FRF has varied between 0.2% and 0.6% of the GDP during the last six decades. Since the 1960s, the US FRF contribution has fallen from twice that of industrial research funding to roughly equal. Also, in the last two decades, the portion of the US government R&D spending devoted to research has increased. Although well below the US and the EU in overall funding, the current growth rate for R&D funding in China greatly exceeds that of both. Finally, the EU currently produces more science and engineering doctoral graduates and scientific publications than the US in absolute terms, but not per capita. This study's aim is to facilitate a serious discussion of key questions by the research community and federal policy makers. In particular, our results raise two questions with respect to: a) the increasing globalization of science: What role is the US playing now, and what role will it play in the future of international science?; and b) the ability to produce beneficial innovations for society: How will the US continue to foster its strengths?.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Background: In 2002, the oil tanker Prestige spilled more than 67 000 tons of bunker oil, heavily contaminating the coast of northwestern Spain. Objective: To assess respiratory effects and chromosomal damage in clean-up workers of the oil spill 2 years after the exposure. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Fishermen cooperatives in coastal villages. Participants: Local fishermen who were highly exposed (n = 501) or not exposed (n = 177) to oil 2 years after the spill. Measurements: Respiratory symptoms; forced spirometry; methacholine challenge; markers of oxidative stress (8-isoprostane), airway inflammation (interleukins, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and interferon-\u03b3), and growth factor activity in exhaled breath condensate; and chromosomal lesions and structural alterations in circulating lymphocytes. Results: Compared with nonexposed participants, persons exposed to oil were at increased risk for lower respiratory tract symptoms (risk difference, 8.0 [95% CI, 1.1 to 14.8]). Lung function did not significantly differ between the groups. Among nonsmoking participants, exposed individuals had higher exhaled 8-isoprostane levels than nonexposed individuals (geometric mean ratio, 2.5 [CI, 1.7 to 3.7]), and exposed individuals with lower respiratory tract symptoms had higher 8-isoprostane levels than those of exposed individuals without symptoms. Exposed nonsmoking participants also had higher levels of exhaled vascular endothelial growth factor (risk difference, 44.8 [CI, 27.9 to 61.6]) and basic fibroblast growth factor (risk difference, 16.0 [CI, 3.5 to 28.6]). A higher proportion of exposed participants had structural chromosomal alterations (risk difference, 27.4 [CI, 10.0 to 44.8]), predominantly unbalanced alterations. The risk for elevated levels of exhaled 8-isoprostane, vascular endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor and structural chromosomal alterations seemed to increase with intensity of exposure to clean-up work. Limitations: The clinical significance of exhaled biomarkers and chromosomal findings are uncertain. The association between oil exposure and the observed changes may not be causal. The findings may not apply to spills involving other types of oil or to different populations of oil spill workers. Conclusion: Participation in clean-up of a major oil spill was associated with persistent respiratory symptoms, elevated markers of airway injury in breath condensate, and chromosomal damage.

There have been several international initiatives, agreements and acts of cooperation, in parallel with legislation that enforces strict constraints and obligations on manufacturers for their products, based on the principles of the extended producer responsibility. This paper presents a methodological framework for integrated assessment, developed to support optimal decision-making regarding the rationalised management of electrical and electronic equipment at the end of their useful life. The resulting waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) has become a top-priority owing to its increasing volume and high value, as well as hazardous content. The proposed framework has been designed as the coordination interface between the government, producers and all relevant stakeholders. The framework targets the promotion of reuse strategies according to the European Union waste framework directive and the pending recast of the WEEE directive. In order to assist decision-making as regards end-of-life alternatives, a multicriteria-based methodological approach has been developed and described herein. An application of the introduced framework is demonstrated.",

    "title": "Ganma theory and third-sector sport-development programmes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth: Implications for sports management",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Sport-development programmes provide opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth to excel and overcome social inequities. In Australia, all levels of government have identified sport-development programmes in their policy responses as a method to redress inequity amongst this population. Yet, a recent report has shown that national sport organisations have been more reactive in establishing anti-discrimination policy and less proactive in cultivating culturally inclusive programmes and meaningful sporting experiences (Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, 2007). At the same time, neo-liberal approaches to policy in Australia have seen the emphasis on grassroots community sport-development shift to third-sector organisations. However, little research has examined how the third-sector organisations operate with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and how culturally inclusive the programmes they deliver are for the communities in which they operate. Three case studies with the objectives of analysing organisational approaches to: structure and governance; sport-development philosophies; and cultural inclusiveness of the programmes, are presented here. The case studies were informed by the cultural lens of Ganma, a theory belonging to the Yolngu community of Yirrkala (Marika, Ngurruwutthun, & White, 1992). The case study method included in-depth interviews with programme leaders, reviews of management information systems and programme observation. The findings provided evidence of the importance of culturally inclusive programmes through governance and an informal lived approach to philosophy and culture. The implications for sports management are discussed, including: the benefits of involving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at the board level; the need for collaboration between local communities and partners; the explicit need to empower local communities to develop the skills to sustain programmes and outcomes; and the maintenance of mutually beneficial interactions.

    "title": "Influence of row spacing on water use and yield of rain-fed wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in a no-till system with stubble retention",
    "abstract_cleaned": "A 3-year field study was undertaken to investigate the effect of row spacing on vegetative growth, grain yield and water-use efficiency of wheat. All 3 years of the study experienced 2151% below-average rainfall for the growing season. Widening row spacing led to reduced biomass and tillers on per plant basis which could be related to the reduction in light interception by the wheat canopy in the wide rows which in turn could have reduced assimilate production. Reduction in vegetative growth in 54-cm rows translated into a significant reduction in grain yield which was strongly associated (r2 = 0.71) with the loss of spike density. The pattern of crop water use (evapotranspiration, ET) during the growing season was very similar for the three row-spacing treatments. However, there was some evidence for slightly lower ET (\u223c5%) in 54-cm rows in two growing seasons. More importantly, there was no evidence for increased ET during the post-anthesis phase in wide rows as has been speculated by some researchers. Over the 3 years of the study, grain yield declined by 58% as row spacing increased from 18 to 36cm and by a further 1220% as row spacing increased from 36 to 54cm. There was a consistent decline in water-use efficiency for grain (WUEG) with increasing row spacing over the 3 years. WUEG declined by 611% as crop spacing increased from 18 to 36cm and declined further by 1215% as row spacing increased to 54cm. Lower light interception at wider row spacing could have reduced assimilate production by wheat as well as increased soil evaporation due to lower shading of the soil surface in more open canopies. Growers adopting wider row spacing on these relatively heavy textured soils are likely to experience some reduction in grain yield and WUEG. However, some growers may be prepared to accept a small yield penalty from intermediate row spacing as a trade-off for increased stubble retention and soil health. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Salinity is a major problem affecting the sustainability of agriculture and environment in the Rio Grande river basin in Texas, USA. An accurate data on the spatial distribution of salinity is necessary for developing effective salinity management practices. However, at present information is lacking on the amount and distribution of salts within the Rio Grande river basin. Manual methods of salinity assessment at high spatial resolution are labor intensive, time consuming and involve expensive laboratory analysis. Electromagnetic induction technique (EMI) can be a relatively low cost, non-invasive and rapid alternative for measuring and mapping soil salinity. This project evaluated utility, accuracy and factors affecting the accuracy of EMI technique to delineate salt affected areas within the Rio Grande river basin in the Far West Texas, USA. Results of this project indicated that the EMI technique provided accurate data on spatial distribution of salinity within a geographical location. Furthermore, accuracy of EMI data was influenced by factors such as amount of clay and soil moisture content at the time of EMI survey. Results also indicated that the EMI technique is rapid, cheaper, and provides accurate spatial data at a much higher resolution than the conventional manual method. ",

The results of analysis show that the energy and exergy efficiencies of the furnace are 56.9% and 40.5%, respectively. Field data show that mass flow rate of hot flue gas is around 10.4 kg/s in average which contains 18.3% and 12.2% of total input energy and exergy, respectively. By using energy of flue gas for preheating the sponge iron, electrical energy consumption of the furnace could be reduced up to 88 GJ which means 21.2% reduction in electrical energy consumption and 13.6% increase in steel production. Also, exergy efficiency improves about 10.8% by using preheating scheme. ",

Nearly 34 species of herbal plants belonging to 24 families have been observed in these villages. Analysis of 27 plant and 27 soil samples for concentrations of toxic heavy metals (cadmium, chromium and lead) reveals relatively higher concentrations of cadmium (4.81 \u03bcug mL -1) and chromium (1.472 \u03bcg mL -1) in the plants when compared with the soil samples. In addition to this, 22 water samples were collected and their physiochemical parameters like pH, salinity, chloride, carbonate and bicarbonate were analyzed. The results obtained indicate that pH and chloride do not seem to influence the bioavilability of toxic heavy metals. Further work is required to establish the relationships among physiochemical characters of the water, soil, accumulation of heavy metals in plants and their physiology. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "In Germany, environmental monitoring data are collected at different locations and in different environmental components by several federal monitoring networks. According to the scientific and legal demands, these data should be made available by integrating them into a web-based geographical information system (WebGIS) and described by harmonised metadata. This enables a spatial and temporal assessment of long-term environmental impacts induced by climate change, for example, as being one issue of the holistic approach, achievable through research strategies of the ILTER (International Long-Term Ecological Research). This chapter on hand describes a WebGIS that was implemented by using Open Source software and filled with geodata and metadata on relevant long-term environmental networks in Germany (LTER-D). The latter were gathered by using an online questionnaire being answered for a total of nine different monitoring networks describing atmosphere, soils, groundwater, biota and marine ecosystems at around 300 monitoring sites. The questionnaire and the WebGIS itself were implemented by using Open Source software, solely. Feasibility and surplus of the WebGIS were demonstrated by investigating the spatiotemporal trends of the metal bioaccumulation in Germany's ecoregions. The technological framework implemented for gathering and linking of environmental data from different monitoring networks proved to be an adequate and effective tool for an integrated investigation of long-term environmental changes. Hence, efforts should be improved to promote long-term ecosystem research in the LTER-D community and to accelerate integration of monitoring data and results into European and global long-term monitoring programmes.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Institutes often lack funds and manpower to perform large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Citizens can be involved, contributing to the collection of data, thus decreasing costs. Underwater research requires specialist skills and SCUBA certification, and it can be difficult to involve volunteers. The aim of this study was to involve large numbers of recreational divers in marine biodiversity monitoring for increasing the environmental education of the public and collecting data on the status of marine biodiversity. Here we show that thousands of recreational divers can be enrolled in a short time. Using specially formulated questionnaires, nonspecialist volunteers reported the presence of 61 marine taxa encountered during recreational dives, performed as regular sport dives. Validation trials were carried out to assess the accuracy and consistency of volunteer-recorded data, and these were compared to reference data collected by an experienced researcher. In the majority of trials (76%) volunteers performed with an accuracy and consistency of 50-80%, comparable to the performance of conservation volunteer divers on precise transects in other projects. The recruitment of recreational divers involved the main diving and tour operators in Italy, a popular scientific magazine, and mass media. During the four-year study, 3825 divers completed 18 757 questionnaires, corresponding to 13 539 diving hours. The volunteersightings-based index showed that in the monitored area the biodiversity status did not change significantly within the project time scale, but there was a significant negative correlation with latitude, suggesting improved quality in the southernmost areas. This trend could be related to the presence of stressors in the northern areas and has been supported by investigations performed by the Italian Ministry of the Environment. The greatest limitation with using volunteers to collect data was the uneven spatial distribution of samples. The benefits were the considerable amounts of data collected over short time periods and at low costs. The successful development of citizen-based monitoring programs requires open-mindedness in the academic community; advantages of citizen involvement in research are not only adding large data sets to the ecological knowledge base but also aiding in the environmental education of the public.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Hexagonal birnessite (\u03b4-MnO2) is a close analogue to the dominant phase in hydrogenetic marine ferromanganese crusts and nodules. These deposits contain ~0.25wt.% Cu which is believed to be scavenged from the overlying water column where Cu concentrations are near 0.1\u03bcg/L. Here, we measured the sorption of Cu on \u03b4-MnO2 as a function of pH and surface loading. We characterized the nature of the Cu sorption complex at pH 4 and 8 using EXAFS spectroscopy and find that, at pH 4, Cu sorbs to birnessite by inner-sphere complexation on the {001} surface at sites above Mn vacancies to give a three to fourfold coordinated complex with 6 Mn neighbors at ~3.4\u00c5. At pH 8, however, we find that some Cu has become structurally incorporated into the MnO2 layer by occupying the vacancy sites to give 6 Mn neighbors at ~2.91\u00c5. Density functional calculations on CuMn18O24(OH)30(H2O)3-4 and CuMn18O21(OH)33(H2O)3-1 clusters predict a threefold coordinated surface complex and show that the change from surface complexation to structural incorporation is a response to protonation of oxygens surrounding the vacancy site. Consequently, we propose that the transformation between sorption via surface complex and vacancy site occupancy should be reversible. By fitting the Cu sorption as a function of surface loading and pH to the formation of the observed and predicted surface complex, we developed a surface complexation model (in the basic Stern approximation) for the sorption of Cu onto birnessite. Using this model, we demonstrate that the concentration of inorganic Cu in the deep ocean should be several orders of magnitude lower than the observed total dissolved Cu. We propose that the observed total dissolved Cu concentration in the oceans reflects solubilization of Cu by microbially generated ligands. .",

This is particularly serious in dentistry and nursing, but is increasingly also true in medicine. To make up for this shortfall there is a growing reliance on part-time clinical teachers.Context: Part-time clinical teachers are essential for the education of students. However, compared with their full-time counterparts, the part-time teachers are often not adequately prepared for their roles as educators within the context of the clinical curriculum. They might not be trained in the latest educational practices, and may be unprepared for the time needed to excel as teachers and mentors.Implications: As part-time teachers take on more responsibility, it is important that they take part in orientation and training sessions to assist them in developing the skills they need to succeed. This will require a significant commitment from the institution as well as the part-time teacher, but is critical for maintaining the academic quality of the clinical training programmes. This also represents an untapped area for research into how to ensure the success of part-time clinical teachers.  2010.",

Some argue that a direct relationship exists and others that unobserved factors correlated with both income and attainment drive the relationship. This paper explores the relationship between income and the intra-household dispersion of education attainment among children. We employ data from Brazil, which like many developing countries displays greater variation in intra-household education attainment than most high-income countries. Unlike prior analyses, IV estimation is employed to control for endogeneity and other biases. Contrary to prior findings, we report a robust monotonically declining relationship between the intra-household dispersion of education attainment and instrumented income. This relationship is consistent with child specialization in poor households suggested by recent theoretical work and has important policy implications. ",

However, compared with other large-scale infrastructure in the landscape, there has been relatively little research on the perceptions of transmission lines. Consequently, the aim of this study was to analyse how transmission lines are perceived in comparison with other landscape elements and how the perceptions of existing transmission lines differ from those concerning new lines. Finally, the heterogeneity of the perceptions was examined with the aid of the latent class method. The study was based on survey data from an urban fringe community in southern Finland. The results confirmed the presupposition that transmission lines are generally perceived as negative landscape elements, both when long-established and when new. However, the perceptions among the residents were heterogeneous. This heterogeneity was explained with environmental attitudes and leisure activities as well as knowledge and land ownership. The results have implications for planning, public communication and participation related to transmission lines, as well as other visually dominating man-made structures in the landscape. .",

There is therefore a need for a cheap and scalable solution to meet these challenges. We claim that this requires more local intelligence associated with the network elements and communication between these units.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Nearly one-third of the Scottish population is struggling to heat their home properly today. There is an urgent need for the delivery of low-energy affordable homes. However, the homebuilding industry has no systematic way to deliver such unconventional homes, although the UK government has set out a bold green target that all newly-built homes be carbon neutral by 2016. Accordingly, this paper explores the status quo of today's affordable homes being built in Scotland; and secondly, it extends the scope to the review of successfully commercialized low- to zero-energy affordable housing developments in Canada. This study emphasizes the significant impact of design choices on the delivery of low- to zero-energy affordable housing, including housing orientations and configurations; construction materials and systems, including renewable energy technologies; and internal planning, with due consideration to the time-related sun positions and the internal space day-lighting and heat gain potentials. In addition, the paper argues that the absence of clear definitions as to housing quality and affordability, and the lack of industry capacity for technical knowledge learning activities, are potential obstacles that limit the spread of sustainable zero-carbon homes in Scotland today. Moreover, the effect of the design charrette approach being practiced in Canada on the homebuilding decision making process was reviewed, with the aim of providing a base for further discussion on the applicability of Canadian low-energy affordable housing design techniques to sustainable zero carbon homes of the future in Scotland.",

    "title": "The palliative care interdisciplinary team: where is the community pharmacist?",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Palliative care emphasizes an interdisciplinary approach to care to improve quality of life and relieve symptoms. Palliative care is provided in many ways; in hospices, hospital units, and the community. However, the greatest proportion of palliative care is in the community. In hospice and palliative care units in hospitals, clinical pharmacists are part of the interdisciplinary team and work closely with other health care professionals. Their expertise in the therapeutic use of medications is highly regarded, particularly as many palliative care patients have complex medication regimens, involving off-label or off-license prescribing that increases their risk for drug-related problems. However, this active involvement in the palliative care team is not reflected in the community setting, despite the community pharmacist being one of the most accessible professionals in the community, and visiting a community pharmacist is convenient for most people, even those who have limited access to private or public transport. This may be due to a general lack of understanding of skills and knowledge that particular health professionals bring to the interdisciplinary team, a lack of rigorous research supporting the necessity for the community pharmacist's involvement in the team, or it could be due to professional tensions. If these barriers can be overcome, community pharmacists are well positioned to become active members of the community palliative care interdisciplinary team and respond to the palliative care needs of patients with whom they often have a primary relationship.",

    "title": "Applying Climate Change Adaptation in Spatial Planning Processes",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Natural hazards play an increasingly important role in societal contexts due to rising casualties and costs observed in the last decades, which is often attributed to Climate Change impacts. Climate Change adaptation and natural hazards have entered European regional policy relatively recently but are quickly growing in importance. In addition to several national and regional Climate Change adaptation strategies the Territorial Agenda of the European Union and the EU White Paper on Climate Change Adaptation mention Climate Change and hazard related risk management as key role in European regional development. But in this argument it is often overlooked that human societies have developed settlements in hazard prone areas, sometimes despite better knowledge. Spatial planning could be a very useful tool to protect settlements from hazard impacts but its full range of potential is seldom applied or overruled by other priorities. It is of interest to observe how human beings have dealt with various natural hazards since the beginning of societies, first of all to understand motivations, and secondly to use this knowledge for new adaptation concepts, including potential impacts of Climate Change. The decision making processes that lead to hazard adaptation concepts are one of the key foci, as well as the possibilities and feasibilities to integrate Climate Change adaptation concepts. Concrete examples of human increases in vulnerabilities and the development of adaptation concepts are given from a case study in the Baltic Sea Region.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Whereas the effect of parasites on food webs is increasingly recognised and has been extensively measured and modelled, the effect of food webs on the structure of parasite assemblages has not been quantified in a similar way. Here, we apply the concept of decay in community similarity with increasing distance, previously used for parasites in geographical, phylogenetic and ontogenetic contexts, to differences in the trophic level (TL) based on diet composition of fishes. It is proposed as an accurate quantitative method to measure rates of assemblage change as a function of host feeding habits and is applied, to our knowledge for the first time, across host species in marine waters. We focused on a suite of 15 species of trophically-transmitted and non-specific larval helminths across 16 fish species (1783 specimens, six orders, 14 families) with different sizes and TLs, gathered from the same ecosystem. Not all host species harboured the same number and types of parasites, reflecting the differences in their ecological characteristics. Using differences in TL and body length as measurements of size and trophic distances, we found that similarity at both infracommunity and component community levels showed a very clear decay pattern, based on parasite abundance and relative abundance, with increasing distance in TL, but was not related to changes in fish size, with TL thus emerging as the main explanatory factor for similarity of parasite assemblages. Furthermore, the relationships between host TL and assemblage similarity allowed identification of fishes for which the TL was under- or over-estimated and prediction of the TL of host species based on parasite data alone.

Advances in our understanding of the biosynthesis, structure and function of complex glycans from mammalian origin have shown the crucial role of this class of molecules to modulate disease processes and the importance of a deeper knowledge of structure-activity relationships. Marine environment offers a tremendous biodiversity and original polysaccharides have been discovered presenting a great chemical diversity that is largely species specific. The study of the biological properties of the polysaccharides from marine eukaryotes and marine prokaryotes revealed that the polysaccharides from the marine environment could provide a valid alternative to traditional polysaccharides such as glycosaminoglycans. Marine polysaccharides present a real potential for natural product drug discovery and for the delivery of new marine derived products for therapeutic applications. ",

In addition to this, unfavorable government forest policy and ignoring people's participation in decision-making and changing climatic conditions are some of the prime factors responsible for changing traditional resource management practices. Over increasing population pressure demand lead for market oriented commercial demand has resulted in over-exploitation of some of the plant resources at alarming pace. This calls for the development of resource management techniques built up on traditional knowledge capable of meeting the challenges of conservation on the one hand and socio-economic development of the local people on the other.

    "abstract_cleaned": "This article explores the principles that should guide efforts to raise finance for climate action in developing countries. The main conclusions are that, first, there is an important role for private finance, which would be facilitated by having pervasive and broadly uniform emissions pricing around the world. Second, public finance is warranted by a range of market\u2013and policy\u2013failures associated with climate change and its mitigation. Third, raising tax revenues may be preferable to borrowing as a means of raising public finance, although the economics is not clear-cut. Public finance theory advocates taxing \u2018bads\u2019, a number of which have escaped the tax base so far. However, it discourages hypothecation of specific revenue streams to particular uses. Fourth, how much could or should be raised by the many specific proposals for finance for climate action in developing countries is often uncertain. So is how multiple schemes would interact. Several schemes could depress carbon prices. Earmarking is often assumed to be justified despite arguments to the contrary. Fifth, two sets of proposals do particularly well when judged against this analysis: (i) expanding the scale and scope of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and (ii) expanding the use of international financial institutions\u2019 balance sheets.

There are few data about neonatal neurobehavior performance that may interfere in their development. Objectives: To compare the neurobehavior of healthy late preterm and full-term neonates born to adolescent mothers. Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study included infants with a gestational age of 400/7-406/7 weeks (full term) and 340/7-366/7 weeks (late preterm) aged 24-72 h without exposure to alcohol, tobacco, drugs or infections and free of clinical problems during the first 3 days of life. Infants were assessed with the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS). Outcomes were analyzed by ANOVA. Results: From July 2001 to November 2002, 3,685 infants were born, 928 of adolescent mothers. After exclusion, 36 late preterm and 96 term infants were enrolled. Adjusted for anesthesia type, delivery mode, gender, age at NNNS examination, time between last feeding and examination, and examination duration, late preterm, compared to term neonates, presented lower scores for attention (p = 0.041), arousal (p = 0.011), regulation (p < 0.001), quality of movements (p < 0.001) and higher scores for non-optimal reflexes (p < 0.001) and hypotonicity (p = 0.029). Conclusion: Late preterm infants of adolescent mothers have a more immature neurobehavioral performance at 24-72 h of life in multiple areas compared to term neonates suggesting a need for careful follow-up.

However, their presence in terrestrial ecosystems has long been overlooked, and their contribution to the nitrogen cycling in natural and agricultural soils is currently unknown. Here we describe the enrichment and characterization of anammox bacteria from a nitrogen-loaded peat soil. After 8 months of incubation with the natural surface water of the sampling site and increasing ammonium and nitrite concentrations, anammox cells constituted 40 to 50% of the enrichment culture. The two dominant anammox phylotypes were affiliated with Candidatus Jettenia asiatica and Candidatus Brocadia fulgida. The enrichment culture converted NH4 + and NO2 - to N2 with the previously reported stoichiometry (1:1.27) and had a maximum specific anaerobic ammonium oxidation rate of 0.94 mmol NH4 + \u0307 g (dry weight)-1 \u0307 h-1 at pH 7.1 and 32\u00b0C. The diagnostic anammox-specific lipids were detected at a concentration of 650 ng \u0307 g (dry weight) -1, and pentyl-[3]-ladderane was the most abundant ladderane lipid.

Although the recycling of ILs partly compensate their rather high cost, it is important to develop new synthetic approaches to less expensive and environmentally sustainable ILs based on renewable raw materials. In fact, most of these alternative solvents are still prepared starting from fossil feedstocks. Until now, only a limited number of ionic liquids have been prepared from renewable sources (e.g. hydroxy acids, amino acids, terpenes), and even less from naturally occurring carbohydrates.

In fact, far from being a display of God's omnipotence, it is a confession of divine weakness: God needs Job/the human to fight evil in creation-the latter is here de-moralized, only restrained but ever threatened by inhuman forces, at times monstrous). The persistence of evil torments the innocent (Abel, Job, Jesus, the martyrs of the Shoah...). Job's theme is highlighted from the outset in 1:8-12 where God's insecurity is manifest, depending as it is on an unpredictable human response (1:9). The central point is that there is no deus ex machina as there is no human robot. Job's insistence on this becomes subversive as it routs the principle of distributive justice and promotes one of disinterested righteousness. When Job realizes that his former complaints were a miscarriage of justice toward God, he repents. That is, he realizes that his claimed surplus of justice implied a deficiency of love. At this point, Job proves that he, at least, reveres God without expecting any reward (see 1:9). The satan is defeated and God comes out vindicated by his creature. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Introduction: Alterations in nutritional status have been described as important predictors of mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the association between multiple markers for nutritional status and the mortality rates of patients with CKD on peritoneal dialysis (PD) has not yet been illustrated in previously published data, particularly by using the new definition of protein energy wasting (PEW). Objective: To evaluate the predictive value of malnutrition markers for mortality rates, on the basis of the PEW definition, of PD patients. Materials and Methods: At the start of PD treatment, the nutritional status of 199 patients (mean age, 56 \u00b1 13.3 years; 53% females) was evaluated. Body mass index (BMI), arm circumference, mid-arm muscle circumference, protein and caloric intake (by using a 3-day food record), and serum albumin were all recorded, as well as a subjective global assessment (SGA) and presence of PEW. Cut-off points were defined on the basis of the consensus of the International Society for Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (albumin, <3.8 g/dL; BMI, <23 kg/m2; mid-arm muscle circumference, >10% in comparison with the 50th percentile for the reference population; protein intake, <0.8 g/kg/daily; caloric intake, <25 kcal/kg/daily). The data were obtained retrospectively between the years 2001 and 2008 on the basis of routine nutritional evaluation. Patients were monitored for fatal events from all possible causes. Result: The mean BMI for the population was 26.6 \u00b1 5.0 kg/m2. A median protein intake of 0.94 (0.18 to 4.57) g/kg/daily was reported and 60.3% of the patients reported a protein intake of <0.8 g/kg/daily. With respect to caloric intake, 38.7% of the patients consumed <25 kcal/kg/daily. A median of 3.5 (1.4 to 5.3) g/dL for serum albumin was observed and 29.3% of the patients presented values of <3.8 g/dL. PEW was diagnosed in 17.5% of patients. In the univariate model, being of age >65 years (P = .002), cardiovascular disease (P < .001), diabetes mellitus (P = .02), SGA (P = .02), and albumin (P = .002), were all significant markers for mortality. The presence of patients aged >65 years (P = .02), with diabetes mellitus (P = .057), cardiovascular disease (P = .005), and albumin were considered as independent factors for mortality in this study. Conclusion: SGA, albumin, and PEW were the only nutritional markers found to be associated with mortality in this cohort of PD patients. In the multivariate analysis, after adjusting for classic mortality risk factors, only patients with hypoalbuminemia were found to be at a high risk for mortality at follow-up. These results may be limited by the number of observations and a necessity for confirmation in larger prospective studies. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Trade in ornamental marine species in Australia, a country with relatively stringent import controls, was investigated using a telephone survey of wholesalers and retailers, and a desktop review of internet import databases and hobbyist trading websites. Information on the regulatory framework was obtained from government and other published or online sources, and from staff of regulatory agencies. Although the trade is small relative to that in the USA, Europe and parts of Asia, Australia imports significant numbers of marine fish each year for the aquarium trade. Many of the more than 200 species imported have the potential to become environmental and/or economic pests. Imported individuals of native species could act as vectors of disease or affect the genetic diversity of native populations if they were released into the wild. Regulatory measures include the use of lists of permitted species of plants and animals, a case-by-case risk assessment process for species not on these lists, and requirements for health certification and quarantining of imported stock. Once within Australia, however, translocation is less rigorously controlled, being managed by individual states and based largely on lists of prohibited species, though generally with scope for case-by-case assessment and refusal of permits for unwanted species, such as recognized pests. Wholesalers and retailers interviewed generally showed a responsible attitude to the disposal of dead or unwanted stock, but awareness and understanding of the potential pest risk of ornamental marine species was generally poor. The importance of raising public awareness of the pest potential of ornamental marine species is likely to increase with the growing importance of mail-order and internet trade. Copyright ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The accumulation and behavior of arsenic at the redox interface of Fe-rich sediments is strongly influenced by Fe(III) precipitate mineralogy, As speciation, and pH. In this study, we examined the behavior of Fe and As during aeration of natural groundwater from the intertidal fringe of a wetland being remediated by tidal inundation. The groundwater was initially rich in Fe 2+ (32 mmol L -1) and As (1.81 \u03bcmol L -1) with a circum-neutral pH (6.05). We explore changes in the solid/solution partitioning, speciation and mineralogy of Fe and As during long-term continuous groundwater aeration using a combination of chemical extractions, SEM, XRD, and synchrotron XAS. Initial rapid Fe 2+ oxidation led to the formation of As(III)-bearing ferrihydrite and sorption of >95% of the As(aq) within the first 4 h of aeration. Ferrihydrite transformed to schwertmannite within 23 days, although sorbed/coprecipitated As(III) remained unoxidized during this period. Schwertmannite subsequently transformed to jarosite at low pH (2-3), accompanied by oxidation of remaining Fe 2+. This coincided with a repartitioning of some sorbed As back into the aqueous phase as well as oxidation of sorbed/coprecipitated As(III) to As(V). Fe(III) precipitates formed via groundwater aeration were highly prone to reductive dissolution, thereby posing a high risk of mobilizing sorbed/coprecipitated As during any future upward migration of redox boundaries. Longer-term investigations are warranted to examine the potential pathways and magnitude of arsenic mobilization into surface waters in tidally reflooded wetlands. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The type and intensity of forest management directly influences regional catchment hydrology. Future forest management must optimise the effects of its practices to achieve sustainable management. With scenario analysis of forestry practices, the effects of different forest utilisation strategies on the hydrology of forested catchments can be temporally and spatially quantified. The approach adopted in this study necessitated the development of an interactive system for the spatially distributed modelling of hydrology in relation to forest stand development. Consequently, a forest growth model was used to simulate stand development assuming various forest management activities. Selected simulated forest growth parameters were entered into the hydrological model to simulate water fluxes under different conditions of forest structure. The approach enables the spatially differentiated quantification of changes in the water regime (e.g. increased evapotranspiration). The results of hydrological simulations in the study area, the Oker catchment (northern Harz Mountains), show that forests contribute to the protection of water systems because they have a balancing effect on the hydrological regime. As scenario simulations also suggest, however, forestry practices can also lead to substantial changes in water budgets of forested catchments. The preservation of the hydrological services of forests requires a sustainable and long-term forest conversion on the basis of current management directives for near natural silviculture. Management strategies on basis of moderate harvesting regimes are preferred because of their limited impact on the water budget. 0 License.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Mantamonas is a novel genus of marine gliding zooflagellates probably related to apusomonad and planomonad Apusozoa. Using phase and differential interference contrast microscopy we describe the type species Mantamonas plastica sp. n. from coastal sediment in Cumbria, England. Cells are ~5\u03bcm long, ~5\u03bcm wide, asymmetric, flattened, biciliate, and somewhat plastic. The posterior cilium, on which they glide smoothly over the substratum, is long and highly acronematic. The much thinner, shorter, and almost immobile anterior cilium points forward to the cell's left. These morphological and behavioural traits suggest that Mantamonas is a member of the protozoan phylum Apusozoa. Analyses of 18S and 28S rRNA gene sequences of Mantamonas plastica and a second genetically very different marine species from coastal sediment in Tanzania show Mantamonas as a robustly monophyletic clade, that is very divergent from all other eukaryotes. 18S rRNA trees mostly place Mantamonas within unikonts (opisthokonts, Apusozoa, and Amoebozoa) but its precise position varies with phylogenetic algorithm and/or taxon and nucleotide position sampling; it may group equally weakly as sister to Planomonadida, Apusomonadida or Breviata. On 28S rRNA and joint 18/28S rRNA phylogenies (including 11 other newly obtained apusozoan/amoebozoan 28S rRNA sequences) it consistently strongly groups with Apusomonadida (Apusozoa). ",

    "title": "Taxonomic versus allometric constraints on non-linear interaction strengths",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Recently, the importance of body mass and allometric scaling for the structure and dynamics of ecological networks has been highlighted in several ground-breaking studies. However, advances in the understanding of generalities across ecosystem types are impeded to a considerable extent by a methodological dichotomy contrasting a considerable portion of marine ecology on the one hand opposite to traditional community ecology on the other hand. Many marine ecologists are bound to the taxonomy-neglecting size spectrum approach when describing and analysing community patterns. In contrast, the mindset of the other school is focused on taxonomies according to the Linnean system at the cost of obscuring information due to applying species or population averages of body masses and other traits. Following other pioneering studies, we addressed this lingering gap, and studied non-linear interaction strengths (i.e. functional responses) between two taxonomically-distinct terrestrial arthropod predators (centipedes and spiders) of varying individual body masses and their prey. We fitted three non-linear functional response models to the data: (1) a taxonomic model not accounting for variance in body masses amongst predator individuals, (2) an allometric model ignoring taxonomic differences between predator individuals, and (3) a combined model including body mass and taxonomic effects. Ranked according to their AICs, the combined model performs better than the allometric model, which provides a superior fit to the data than the taxonomic model. These results strongly indicate that the body masses of predator and prey individuals were responsible for most of the variation in non-linear interaction strengths. Taxonomy explained some specific patterns in allometric exponents between groups and revealed mechanistic insights in predation efficiencies. Reconciling quantitative allometric models as employed by the marine size-spectrum approach with taxonomic information may thus yield quantitative results that are generalized across ecosystem types and taxonomic groups. Using these quantitative models as novel null models should also strengthen subsequent taxonomic analyses. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Objectives: To describe the receipt of controlling behaviors in young women's dating relationships and the association with physical and sexual relationship violence (RV) and to ascertain whether young women experiencing controlling from partners support RV screening and respond honestly. Design: Anonymous audio computer-assisted self-interview. Setting: Reproductive health center. Participants: A total of 603 women aged 15 to 24 years seeking reproductive care. Main Outcome Measures: Self-reported victimization (controlling behaviors and physical and sexual aggression) by a partner in the past year. Results: Sixty-eight percent of participants reported receiving 1 or more episodes of controlling behavior by a partner: 38.1% reported experiencing only controlling behaviors; 11.4% and 10.0% reported receiving controlling behaviors plus physical or sexual victimization, respectively; and 8.6% reported all forms of RV. Adjusted Poisson regression found that age 15 to 18 years (relative risk, 1.40), Hispanic ethnicity (1.29), childhood exposure to domestic violence (1.11), ever pregnant (1.21), older partner (1.28), recent physical (1.89) or sexual (1.93) victimization, and uncomfortable asking for condom use (1.39) were significantly associated with increased episodes of controlling behavior by a partner. Younger women and those who reported being victimized by controlling behaviors were more than twice as likely to object to screening by a health care provider, and those who reported receiving these behaviors were 2.5 times more likely to report that they might not honestly disclose RV. Conclusions: Controlling behaviors are strongly associated with physical and sexual RV. Young women experiencing controlling behaviors are more reticent about screening for RV and may not feel that they can answer honestly.  All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Medical student surgery elective in rural Haiti: A novel approach to satisfying clerkship requirements while providing surgical care to an underserved population",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Background: The addition of global health programs to medical school training results in graduates with enhanced clinical skills and increased sensitivity to cost issues. Funding from U.S. medical schools has been unable to meet student demand, and therefore it is often a critical limiting factor to the lack of development of these programs. We describe an alternative approach for global health surgical training for medical students. Methods: Emory University medical students and faculty, in collaboration with Project Medishare for Haiti, planned, raised funds, and executed a successful short-term surgical camp to supplement available surgical services in rural Haiti. Learning objectives that satisfied Emory University School of Medicine surgery clerkship requirements were crafted, and third-year students received medical school credit for the trip. Results: In the absence of house staff and placed in an under-resourced, foreign clinical environment, the surgical elective described here succeeded in meeting learning objectives for a typical third-year surgical clerkship. Objectives were met through a determined effort to ensure that home institution requirements were aligned properly with learning activities while students were abroad and through a close collaboration between medical students, faculty members, and the administration. Conclusions: Emory University's international surgery elective for medical students demonstrates that opportunities for supervised, independent student-learning and global health service can be integrated into a traditional surgical clerkship. These opportunities can be organized to meet the requirements and expectations for third-year surgery clerkships at other medical colleges. This work also identifies how such trips can be planned and executed in a manner that does not burden strained academic budgets with further demands on resources. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Palaeoecology may contribute to the debate on nature conservation and the preservation of cultural heritage. Here we present two palaeo-records from the Lore Lindu Biosphere Reserve and National Park in central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The park comprises one of the largest remaining and most biodiverse mountain forests of Sulawesi. Outstanding megalithic sites reveal long-term human impact on the area. Thus, modern vegetation composition within the park has been determined by complex site histories, natural and anthropogenic. Palaeo-records from sites between 1,000 and 1,400 m a. s. l. demonstrate that human activity as well as climate variations have to be considered as the main drivers of vegetation changes in the region for the last 2,000 years. Human impact is reflected by large amounts of charred fragments in the pollen records plus low values of arboreal pollen resulting from forest clearance. The stratigraphy of one of the pollen records shows effects of a general cooling trend during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Biomass loss due to the conversion of lower montane rainforest to grassland has reduced the carbon storage potential in the area of the Lore Lindu Park. Recommendations for conservation policy that may be made from the environmental history within the biosphere reserve thus include the consideration of human influence in easily accessible areas, particularly in face of recent settlement intensification.

In November and December of 2009, 22 artisanal fishermen associated with the Tramanda\u00ed Fishermen's Union were interviewed. During these interviews, questionnaires were employed utilizing both open and closed questions that dealt with behavioral ecology, biological and interactional issues related to bottlenose dolphins, and small-scale fishing in the region. All those interviewed described  boto fishing, in which bottlenose dolphins  helped out the fishermen. According to these interviews, this kind of fishing, marked by close interaction between humans and '. botos,' allows nets to be cast fewer times and with captured fish yields that are greater than, when there is no dolphin is present. The fishermen maintain that this increased productivity results from '. botos' showing them exactly where the schools of fish are located below the water surface. This has made it possible to observe the impact that dolphin fishing has on the monthly incomes of these fishermen, and there is concern among fishermen, that the intense tourism may one day contribute to the disappearance of the '. boto,' a situation, they believe would negatively affect their fishing activities. .",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) continue to be one of the most pervasive and costly of the substance use disorders (SUDs). Despite evidence of clinical effectiveness, adoption of medications for the treatment of AUDs is suboptimal. Low rates of AUD medication adoption have been explained by characteristics of both treatment organizations and individual counselor's attitudes and behaviors. However, few studies have simultaneously examined the impact of organizational-level and counselor-level characteristics on counselor perceptions of EBPs. To address this gap in the literature, we use data from a national sample of 1178 counselors employed in 209 privately funded treatment organizations to examine the effects of organizational and individual counselor characteristics on counselor attitudes toward tablet and injectable naltrexone. Results of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) show that organizational characteristics (use of tablet/injectable naltrexone in the program, 12-step orientation) were associated with counselor perceptions of naltrexone. Net of organizational characteristics, several counselor level characteristics were associated with attitudes toward tablet and injectable naltrexone including gender, tenure in the field, recovery status, percentage of AUD patients, and receipt of medication-specific training. These findings reveal that counselor receptiveness toward naltrexone is shaped in part by the organizational context in which counselors are embedded. .",

It is assumed that per capita CO2 emissions are correspondent to the share of industrial value added in GDP. A model is developed using hidden Markov process to search this initial assumption. In the model, the data for industrial share in GDP are assigned to be the observations, while the data for per capita CO2 emissions represent the hidden process, which may be then predicted using the ratio of industrial value added to GDP. The data set covers the period from 1970 to 2008 and the model is tested for the G-7 countries. The study findings show that, except in the case of Canada, the hidden Markov model performs reasonably well in tracking per capita CO2 emissions.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Protected area management in Norway is undergoing institutional changes with the implementation of management models aimed at increased public participation. At the same time tourism enterprises are increasing in number within the protected areas. Greater levels of interaction with stakeholders place new demands on lead institutions in terms of communication, transparency, involvement, and power sharing. A governance perspective was used to examine some facets of the interaction between a local council managing a national park in Norway and tourism companies using the park for their operations. The main objective was to assess how the tourism sector perceives the cooperation and interface with the management institution. Semi-structured interviews were used, together with a framework of United Nations Development Programme principles of good governance: legitimacy and voice, direction, performance, accountability, and fairness. The results showed rather negative evaluations by the tourism sector, and operators expressed views, implying that the current management model fails to achieve most of the principles of good governance. Although based on a one-sided view by one group of stakeholders, the study suggests that lack of access to important processes and decisions, perceived bias towards traditional conservation, neglect of cultural heritage, and undue restrictions on access could have serious implications for developing an effective management model.

STP is therefore an important input of pharmaceuticals in the study area. Colloidal phase was further separated from bulk water samples using cross-flow ultrafiltration (CFUF), confirming it being an effective sorbent for pharmaceuticals with high sorption capacity which are 2-4 orders of magnitude higher than SPM. Moreover, mass balance calculations showed that significant percentages of selected pharmaceutical compounds were associated with aquatic colloids, indicating colloids as a reservoir for these contaminants in the Yangtze estuarine system.

Under the assumption that forecasters optimally update their beliefs about past, current, and future state variables as new information arrives, we use our model to extract information on the degree of predictability of the state variable and the importance of measurement errors in the observables. Empirical estimates of the model are obtained using survey forecasts of annual GDP growth and inflation in the United States with forecast horizons ranging from 1 to 24 months, and the model is found to closely match the joint realization of forecast errors at different horizons. Our empirical results suggest that professional forecasters face severe measurement error problems for GDP growth in real time, while this is much less of a problem for inflation. Moreover, inflation exhibits greater persistence, and thus is predictable at longer horizons, than GDP growth and the persistent component of both variables is well approximated by a low-order autoregressive specification.

    "abstract_cleaned": "The process of hatching has been well studied in some model species of teleosts: the medaka Oryzias latipes, the mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus, and the zebrafish Danio rerio. These models are compared to the California Grunion, Leuresthes tenuis that has some unique features of reproduction related to tidal synchrony of spawning and environmentally cued hatching (ECH). During oviposition at spring tides, this marine teleost spawns out of water to bury its clutches on sandy beaches in the high intertidal zone. After embryos of L. tenuis reach hatching competence, hatching can be triggered at any time. Incubation above the water line inhibits hatching until ECH is triggered by rising tides during the following lunar phase, and hatching occurs within a few seconds. We review the embryo's response to environmental cues at hatching and the effects of the surrounding medium on the chorionase and chorion for this form of ECH. Leuresthes tenuis shares some similarities as well as some important differences with the model species. Comparison of hatching across teleostean taxa indicates great variability in stage at hatching and in duration of incubation that suggest hatching plasticity in response to environmental cues may be more widespread than currently appreciated.

Its process and development is the core of soil erosion dynamic mechanics, and also is the key for the prevention of soil and water loss and development of physical model for soil erosion prediction. Based upon indoor simulated rainfall experiment, the effect of vegetation regulating on slope water erosion was studied systematically. The results show that rainfall intensity is the main factor affecting runoff, its contribution ratio of runoff is 87%, and slope gradient is the main factor affecting sediment, its contribution ratio of sediment is 76%, which is more obvious in strong rainfall or on steep slope. Vegetation coverage has more influence on runoff and sediment yield than slope gradient. Vegetation distributed in the lower slope conserves soil better than that in the upper and middle slopes under the same vegetation coverage condition. With increase of the vegetation coverage, the runoff volume and runoff erosion power decrease within the power function distribution range, the total sediment yield decrease within the exponential function distribution range, and the effectiveness of vegetation regulating on runoff and sediment yield is strengthen gradually.

The model can be used to calculate local dissolved oxygen flux, blade-averaged oxygen flux and daily average net primary productivity for a kelp forest. Predicted rates of photosynthetic oxygen flux agree well with previously reported direct measurements. This model was derived from the fundamental principles of conservation of mass and momentum over a flat plate using an integral method approach and is applicable in laminar, transitional and turbulent flows. It predicts oxygen flux as an explicit function of fluid flow conditions above the kelp blade. Experimental velocity profiles and dissolved oxygen concentration profiles, measured under a range of fluid flow conditions, followed power-law scaling and demonstrated local similarity between oxygen and velocity distribution within the boundary layers above the kelp blade. The proposed model provides a useful tool for estimating rates of photosynthesis with minimal data collection. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The experimental study of aerobic granular sludge in sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was performed using a synthetic domestic wastewater and ordinary flocculent activated sludge from the third Sewage Treatment Plant in Xi'an as seeding sludge. The aerobic granular sludge was cultivated successfully when the superficial upflow air velocity was 1.06\u223c1.77 cm/s. The study suggests that the formation of granular sludge is a process of the formation of micro-ecological system. Hydraulic shear stress is a significant impact factor of its formation, which affects the composition of microbial population structure and distribution in aerobic granular sludge. From the analysis of the relationship between filamentous microorganisms and microbial community, zoogloea and filamentous bacteria depend on each other. The filamentous microorganisms formed floc skeleton, which provide the necessary condition for floc to form larger floc particles. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The HIV/AIDS pandemic is a major global health threat and understanding the detailed molecular mechanisms of HIV replication is critical for the development of novel therapeutics. To replicate, HIV-1 must access the nucleus of infected cells and integrate into host chromosomes, however little is known about the events occurring post-nuclear entry but before integration. Here we show that the karyopherin Transportin 3 (Tnp3) promotes HIV-1 integration in different cell types. Furthermore Tnp3 binds the viral capsid proteins and tRNAs incorporated into viral particles. Interaction between Tnp3, capsid and tRNAs is stronger in the presence of RanGTP, consistent with the possibility that Tnp3 is an export factor for these substrates. In agreement with this interpretation, we found that Tnp3 exports from the nuclei viral tRNAs in a RanGTP-dependent way. Tnp3 also binds and exports from the nuclei some species of cellular tRNAs with a defective 3\u2032CCA end. Depletion of Tnp3 results in a re-distribution of HIV-1 capsid proteins between nucleus and cytoplasm however HIV-1 bearing the N74D mutation in capsid, which is insensitive to Tnp3 depletion, does not show nucleocytoplasmic redistribution of capsid proteins. We propose that Tnp3 promotes HIV-1 infection by displacing any capsid and tRNA that remain bound to the pre-integration complex after nuclear entry to facilitate integration. The results also provide evidence for a novel tRNA nucleocytoplasmic trafficking pathway in human cells. ",

We calculate domestic material consumption (DMC), an indicator based on the concept of socio-economic metabolism and economy-wide material flow analysis, and relate it to various socio-economic factors such as changes in political regimes, industrialization and consequent growth in GDP and population. DMC is good at reflecting the gradual industrialization which took place up to the First World War, then the strong focus on the development of heavy industry under communist rule, and finally the swing to a more consumer industry and service-oriented economy after the fall of the communist regime and the subsequent transition from a centrally planned to a market economy. The comparable DMC figures per capita for Czechoslovakia and the United Kingdom prove that we arrived at feasible values of material consumption. .",

The fauna and flora of oceanic islands are particularly susceptible to invasive species and the increase of global movements of humans and their products since WW II has caused numerous anthropogenic translocations and increased the ills of human-mediated invasions. We use a multi-locus genomic dataset to identify geographic origin, pace, pattern and historical process of an invasive scincid lizard (Carlia) that has been inadvertently introduced to Guam, the Northern Marianas, and Palau. This lizard is of major importance as its introduction is thought to have assisted in the establishment of the invasive brown treesnake (Boiga irregularis) on Guam by providing a food resource. Our findings demonstrate multiple waves of introductions that appear to be concordant with movements of Allied and Imperial Japanese forces in the Pacific during World War II. ",

The deprivation in old areas is characterized by underprivileged living conditions, while ex-industrial areas present a more income-based poverty. The authors suggest that this spatial pattern has resulted from underinvestment in old areas before economic reform and economic restructuring of industrial districts under postreform policies. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Background: Pneumonia is the leading cause of child deaths globally. The aims of this study were to: a) estimate the number and global distribution of pneumonia deaths for children 1-59 months for 2008 for countries with low (<85%) or no coverage of death certification using single-cause regression models and b) compare these country estimates with recently published ones based on multi-cause regression models. Methods and Findings: For 35 low child-mortality countries with <85% coverage of death certification, a regression model based on vital registration data of low child-mortality and >85% coverage of death certification countries was used. For 87 high child-mortality countries pneumonia death estimates were obtained by applying a regression model developed from published and unpublished verbal autopsy data from high child-mortality settings. The total number of 1-59 months pneumonia deaths for the year 2008 for these 122 countries was estimated to be 1.18 M (95% CI 0.77 M-1.80 M), which represented 23.27% (95% CI 17.15%-32.75%) of all 1-59 month child deaths. The country level estimation correlation coefficient between these two methods was 0.40. Interpretation: Although the overall number of post-neonatal pneumonia deaths was similar irrespective to the method of estimation used, the country estimate correlation coefficient was low, and therefore country-specific estimates should be interpreted with caution. Pneumonia remains the leading cause of child deaths and is greatest in regions of poverty and high child-mortality. Despite the concerns about gender inequity linked with childhood mortality we could not estimate sex-specific pneumonia mortality rates due to the inadequate data. Life-saving interventions effective in preventing and treating pneumonia mortality exist but few children in high pneumonia disease burden regions are able to access them. To achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goal 4 target to reduce child deaths by two-thirds in year 2015 will require the scale-up of access to these effective pneumonia interventions. ",

Participant students of this study were eighth grade students in three middle schools located in the second biggest city in Korea. Each of the three teachers from three schools taught both the SWH and the control classes. The results of this study showed significant differences between the SWH and the control groups on the SWT. There was a difference in the total RTOP scores between the SWH and the control groups. Differences among schools imply that higher level of teachers' implementation of the SWH approach would appear to result in better student achievement. ",

Four study sites were selected along the river (La Calera city, C\u00f3rdoba city, Coraz\u00f3n de Mar\u00eda village and R\u00edo Primero city) which were sampled during the low- and high-water flow periods. We analyzed: a) chemical and physical characteristics of water, sediments, and riparian soil; b) heavy metal content of water and sediments, and c) semi-volatile organic compounds in air. Besides, pollutant bioindicators such as fish assemblages, lichens (Usnea amblyoclada), vascular plants (Tradescantia pallida), and microorganisms (fecal coliform and Escherichia coli) were used to further assess the status of the river. All analyzed ecological compartments were affected by water pollution, particularly, fish assemblages, sediments and riparian soils by heavy metal and coliform bacteria. Moreover, we detected a possible contribution of sulfur and a high pollutant content in air that merit further research about other air-water exchanges. Accordingly, we strongly suggest that an action to restore or remediate the anthropic effect on the Suqu\u00eda River be extended to all possible compartments along the river. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The five billion persons at the lower economic levels are not only poor, but commonly use technologies that are less efficient and more polluting, wasting their money, hurting their health, polluting their cites, and increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Many first-world researchers, including the authors, are seeking to help these persons achieve a better life by collaborating on need-driven solutions to energy problems. Here we examine three specific examples of solutions to energy problems, and mitigation strategies in the developing world: (1) Energy Efficiency Standards and Labeling in China. Between 1990 and 2025, China will add 675 million new urban residents, all of whom expect housing, electricity, water, transportation, and other energy services. Policies and institutions must be rapidly set up to manage the anticipated rapid rise in household and commercial energy consumption. This process has progressed from legislating, and setting up oversight of minimum energy performance standards in 1989 (now on 30 products) to voluntary efficiency labels in 1999 (now on 40 products) and to mandatory energy labels in 2005 (now on 21 products). The savings from just the standards and labels in place by 2007 would result in cumulative savings of 1188 teraWatt - hours (TWh) between 2000-2020. By 2020, China would save 110 TWh/yr, or the equivalent of 12 gigaWatts (GW) of power operating continuously. (2) Fuel-efficient biomass cookstoves to reduce energy consumption and reduce pollution. Compared to traditional cooking methods in Darfur, the BDS cooks faster, reduces fuel requirement, and emits less carbon monoxide air pollution. A 2010 survey of 100 households showed that users reduced spending on fuelwood in North Darfur camps from 1/2 of household non-fuelwood budget to less than 1/4 of that budget. The survey showed that each $20 stove puts $330/year in the pocket of the women using the stove, worth $1600 over the stove-life of 5 years. Per capita income of these households is about $300/year. (3) Super Efficient Appliance Deployment. Global domestic electricity consumption is expected to double in 25 years, from 5,700 TWh/yr in 2005 to 11,500 TWh/yr in 2030. The four appliances using largest shares of domestic electricity (lighting, refrigeration, air-conditioning, television) would use some 5,000 TWh/yr in 2030, or 43% of the total, in the baseline scenario. More than 50% of this consumption will be in China, India, European Union and US. We outline efforts to save up to 1.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions per year in 2030 by helping deploy the most efficient commercially available technologies in these four categories. Furthermore, if this effort is extended to twenty-four categories of appliances and equipment, the projected savings in CO2 emissions increase to 6.7 gigatons per year by 2030. ",

Unlike flow in closed pipes, flow in open channels is often accompanied by changes in the filling, vegetation in natural conduits, and the varying direction of the moving water.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Nearly a billion people in the world lack access to safe drinking water, two billion have inadequate sanitation facilities, three billion use biomass for their daily energy needs and nearly half the world's population live in rural isolation, lacking access to the most basic human services. Combined, these limitations are a leading cause of the perpetuating cycle of poverty and political insecurity. Meanwhile, the majority of international development agencies are responsible for self-reporting project outcomes. At best, expert spot-checks are conducted in the field occasionally. These results tend to show individual project success, while meta-surveys indicate on-going challenges in the sector. This disconnect may be addressed through independent data monitoring technologies that provide objective data on system performance and use and can be used to demonstrate success and identify project weaknesses. By demonstrating which technologies and programs are truly successful, these successes can be targeted for scaling, through savings realized by eliminating unsuccessful approaches. This will benefit developing communities by providing proven and accountable programs. The Sustainable Water, Energy and Environmental Technologies Laboratory, the SWEETLab\u2122, at Portland State University is working with partners to demonstrate this concept across several applications and countries. The SWEETSense\u2122 technology can provide objective, qualitative and continuous operational data on the usage and performance of programs across a range of sectors and communities. The data is then directly integrated into SWEETData\u2122, an internet database presenting summary statistics on performance and usage of the monitored technologies to front-end users. The SWEETLab\u2122 is currently demonstrating this concept in water, sanitation, household energy and rural infrastructure programs with diverse partners including Mercy Corps, the Lemelson Foundation, Bridges to Prosperity, Manna Energy Limited and Vestergaard Frandsen, in several countries including Indonesia, Haiti, Guatemala and Rwanda. Remote monitoring systems are an innovative method to ensure the success of appropriate technology projects. Rather than infrequent engagement, remote monitoring systems ensure that community partnerships are maintained through continuous monitoring. This approach seeks to raise the quality and accountability of these projects internationally. ",

In South Africa and Swaziland there was little awareness of the potential impact of such instruments on working conditions. In Lesotho, where there is a high profile campaign, workers are more aware of the codes, but confusion over who visitors to factories are, and corporate whitewash, limit the impact of instruments. In all three countries workers perceived the impact of codes of conduct on labour rights as negligible. This differed between firms, with workers in firms supplying to the higher end of the South African market being more positive. Given the absence of coherent global governance of trade in the garment industry, codes of conduct will remain an inadequate response to the abuse of workers' rights, worldwide and in southern Africa.

Current tools for creating and managing these ensembles in HPC environments are limited and difficult to use; this is proving to be a limiting factor to running scientific ensembles at the large scale enabled by these HPC environments. MapReduce and its open-source implementation, Hadoop, is an attractive paradigm due to the simplicity of the programming model and intrinsic mechanisms for handling scalability and fault-tolerance. In this paper, we evaluate the programmability of MapReduce and Hadoop for scientific workflow ensembles. ",

    "title": "Operational hedging strategies to overcome financial constraints during clean technology start-up and growth",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Clean technology startups face multiple sources of uncertainty, and require specialized knowhow and longer periods for revenue growth than their counterparts in other industries. These startups require large investments and have been hit hard during the current credit squeeze. On the other hand, clean technologies create important positive externalities for the economy. Hence, loan guarantees and other incentive schemes are being developed that are conditioned upon operational benchmarks. The authors offer a framework to establish the extent wherein operational hedging can reduce risk and increase the probability of obtaining financing. They examine a variety of evidence, ranging from production outsourcing to creation of joint ventures, to posit that operational hedging may affect both the marginal cost of capital and the marginal return on investment through mitigating the informational problems in the market. However, operational hedging may not be an effective strategy in all settings: the decision for creation of such hedges ought to weigh the benefits of reduced marginal cost of capital and the opportunity cost of reduced future growth potential against a status quo.

    "abstract_cleaned": "The overwintering deployment of an icebreaker during the Canadian Flaw Lead study provided an opportunity to evaluate how protist communities (phytoplankton and other single-celled eukaryotes) respond to changing spring irradiance conditions in flaw lead polynyas, where open water persists between the central pack ice and land fast ice. We combined microscopic analysis of the protist communities (all cell sizes) with clone libraries of 18S rRNA genes and 18S rRNA (from RNA converted to cDNA) of size-fractionated seawater (0. 2-3. 0 \u03bcm) from 10 to 12 m depth in the surface mixed layer. The rRNA gene analysis provided information on the presence of organisms, while the rRNA analysis provided information on the most active members of the community. There was little overlap between the two types of clone libraries, and there were large community shifts over time. Heterotrophic dinoflagellates and ciliates were the most common sequences recovered. The relative proportion of photosynthetic protist sequences increased in March and April, and there was greater representation of Bacillariophyta, Prasinophyta, Haptophyta, and Cryptophyta in the rRNA compared to rRNA gene libraries. Microscopy indicated that large-celled diatoms dominated the community in May, when chlorophyll concentrations were greatest. However, the RNA sequencing showed that heterotrophic and putative parasitic protists were proportionately more active, and the concomitant decrease in nutrients suggested that the spring phytoplankton bloom had begun to decline by this time. These observations provide evidence of substantial changes in protist community structure and function during the spring transition. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The article addresses the claim that the left populist governments of Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela failed to effectively reduce inequality in the 2000s. The author examines the econometric evidence presented by McLeod and Lustig (2011) that the social democratic governments of Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay were more successful and shows that McLeod and Lustig's results are highly sensitive to their use of data from the Socioeconomic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean (SEDLAC). Conducting the same analysis using inequality data from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) suggests the exactly opposite conclusion. The contrast between the results obtained using SEDLAC and ECLAC data suggests that the choice of inequality data source is not immaterial and that the difference is probably driven by how the two sources handle the underreporting of income in household surveys. The key difference between SEDLAC and ECLAC data is that the latter correct for the underreporting of income while the former do not. Absent reasonable criteria for choosing between the two datasets, the author suggests that any econometric results pertaining to Latin American income inequality should prove robust to both data sources.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Objective To quantify the prevalence and trends of stunting among children using the WHO growth standards. Design Five hundred and seventy-six nationally representative surveys, including anthropometric data, were analysed. Stunting was defined as the proportion of children below -2sd from the WHO length- or height-for-age standards median. Linear mixed-effects modelling was used to estimate rates and numbers of affected children from 1990 to 2010, and projections to 2020.Setting One hundred and forty-eight developed and developing countries. Subjects Boys and girls from birth to 60 months. Results In 2010, it is estimated that 171 million children (167 million in developing countries) were stunted. Globally, childhood stunting decreased from 39.7 (95 % CI 38.1, 41.4) % in 1990 to 26.7 (95 % CI 24.8, 28.7) % in 2010. This trend is expected to reach 21.8 (95 % CI 19.8, 23.8) %, or 142 million, in 2020. While in Africa stunting has stagnated since 1990 at about 40 % and little improvement is anticipated, Asia showed a dramatic decrease from 49 % in 1990 to 28 % in 2010, nearly halving the number of stunted children from 190 million to 100 million. It is anticipated that this trend will continue and that in 2020 Asia and Africa will have similar numbers of stunted children (68 million and 64 million, respectively). Rates are much lower (14 % or 7 million in 2010) in Latin America. Conclusions Despite an overall decrease in developing countries, stunting remains a major public health problem in many of them. The data summarize progress achieved in the last two decades and help identify regions needing effective interventions. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The Mornag coastal groundwater underlies the plain of this region. It is in northern Tunisia and 20. km SW of Tunis City. This region is known for its important agricultural activity.This aquifer is the main groundwater resource of the department of this region. To limit the overexploitation, there is a creation of some perimeters in the Naasen and Irrisala localities where wastewater is used. To maintain the hydrostatic groundwater balance, freshwater is injected (artificial refill).In the Nassen area treated wastewater irrigation is slowed and then stopped while the Irrisala perimeter is still irrigated by the same water type. To maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the aquifer, water from the M\u00e9jerda Canal (M.C.) was injected.A geochemical study of the different parts of this groundwater is carried out, in order to clarify the salinisation origin and the hydrochemical evolution of the Mornag groundwater and to estimate the possible relationships between the natural processes (marine water intrusion), the water quality used either for irrigation or for artificial refill, and the geologic environment on the water quality of this aquifer.Its salinity, pH, temperature and electrical conductivity were measured and their respective averages are 3.1. g/l, 7.4, 18.7 \u00b0C and 4.4. mS/cm. The concentrations of sodium, calcium, magnesium, bicarbonate, chloride, sulphate, potassium and bromides were measured and their respective averages are 29.0, 15.1, 10.9, 4.8, 26.8, 10.5, 0.3 and 0.0482. mg/l.rMg2+/rCa2+ and rBr-/rCl- ratios were calculated. The results suggest that the Mornag groundwater can be divided into 4 areas where the water chemistry depends on the natural processes and the water quality used for irrigation and artificial recharge: for the coastal zone, marine water infiltration provokes the increase in salinity of this part of the aquifer;-infiltration of wastewater used for irrigation and run-off water resulted in changing geochemical water quality of these aquifer areas;-stopping of the use of wastewater, irrigation and artificial recharge water with good water quality did improve the aquifer water quality.

First, to estimate the efficiency of conventional and organic date farms in Saudi Arabia, with special reference to the Riyadh province. Second, to show the impacts of relative input use, as an indicator of technology level and specialization degree, as efficiency determinants. Riyadh Province has the main date production and date area, it reaches 23% and 25% of total production and area of dates respectively. It is also a province which is characterized by most of the organic date farms in the Kingdom. Technical, cost, and scale efficiencies are estimated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach, for 82 conventional and 49 organic date farms. The study results show that 22% of conventional date farm technical efficiency have a range of 50-59%, while 32% of them have a cost efficiency range of 40-49%. Technical and cost efficiency ranges were 50-59% and 20-29% for 29% and 39% of organic date farms respectively. The efficiency measures are regressed, using Tobit Model, on a set of explanatory variables which includes efficiency determinants such as water, labor, per hectares. The significant relationship between farm use of water per hectare, as the most scarce resource, and scale efficiency is negative in the case of conventional and organic date farms, i.e. less water use increases scale efficiency. Date farm area relative to total farm area has a positive impact on date farm efficiency. A negative impact of labor, per hectare, on efficiency reflects the importance of applying modern agriculture which required less labor and more technology. ",

Newly developed alumina matrix multifunctional composites (AMMCs) showed promising mechanical properties and frictional performance. AMMCs have potential applications in low friction applications due the presence of low friction components in the matrix. AMMCs were synthesized using powder compaction. To optimize the composition of reinforcement (boron) and to correlate the structure and properties, it is important to understand the effect of reinforcement on the in-situ phase formation and their subsequent effect on the friction and wear properties. Therefore, this study will discuss the effect of boron on in-situ phases and friction of AMMCs. It was found that sintering temperature, composition of reinforcement have influence on the friction and wear resistance of these composites. The wear resistance of the composite was better than alumina.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "In vapour permeation the feed is a vapour, not a liquid as in pervaporation. The process employs a polymeric membrane as a semi-permeable barrier between the feed side under high pressure and the permeate side under low pressure. Separation is achieved by the different degrees to which components are dissolved in and diffuse through the membrane, the system working according to a solution-diffusion mechanism. The materials used in the membrane depend upon the types of compounds being separated, so water transport is favoured by hydrophilic material, whether organic or inorganic. The process is used for the dehydration of natural gas and various organic solvents, notably alcohol as biofuel, as well as the removal of water from air and its recovery from waste steam. Waste steam can be found in almost every plant/factory where steam is used. It is frequently contaminated and cannot be reused. Discharging the spent steam to the atmosphere is a serious energy loss and environmental issue. Recycling the steam can significantly improve the overall energy efficiency of an industry, which is responsible for massive CO2 emissions. Steam separation at high fluxes and temperatures has been accomplished with a composite poly(vinyl alcohol) membrane containing silica nanoparticles, and also, less efficiently, with an inorganic zeolite membrane.

The objective of this study is to evaluate potential impacts of implementing the strategy on farmland and to provide scientific guidelines and decision support for decision makers in northeast China. We analyzed three building a new countryside implementation scenarios (Historical Trend, Intensive Development, and Extensive Development) using the SLEUTH urban growth and land cover change model in combination with remote sensing and GIS analysis. The results indicated that farmland loss was inevitable, but revealed large differences in landscape patterns and the amount of farmland loss among the three BNC implementation scenarios. The Extensive Development scenario showed the largest increase in urban and rural residential land, the highest level of landscape fragmentation, and the largest loss of farmland. Farmland loss under the Intensive Development scenario is higher than that under the Historical Trend scenario; however, urban and rural sprawl and the fragmentation of landscape under the Intensive Development scenario were lower than those under the Historical Trend scenario. Consequently, the Intensive Development scenario was recommended for actual building a new countryside implementation in the study area. Potential rural sprawl under the Intensive Development scenario was also discussed, which provided useful information for guiding scientific-based decision support and policy making. While most studies of sprawl prediction involve urban centers only, our study presents a case of predicting urban and rural sprawl simultaneously. ",

Few researchers have investigated spatial policies appropriate for an alternative plan. We aim to propose a novel approach incorporating constrained cellular automata and regionalized sensitivity analysis, a method for global sensitivity analysis to calculate the realization possibility and identify the spatial policy parameters for an alternative plan. This approach is first tested in a virtual space with four predefined urban forms and various point, line, and polygon spatial constraints, with both positive and negative impacts on urban growth. Finally, the approach is also tested in the Beijing Metropolitan Area to identify the required spatial policy parameters for four alternative plans with seven spatial constraints. ",

    "title": "International courts and sustainable development: Using old tools to shape a new discourse",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Introduction \u2018Sustainable development\u2019 has been the hegemonic global environmental policy for nearly three decades, not only because it offers the tantalising prospect that economic development can be reconciled with environmental protection, but also because it is a highly pliable concept, and can embrace quite different views about how this reconciliation is to be achieved. The plasticity of sustainability has hamstrung efforts to embed the concept in international law, either in treaty form or as a customary rule, while at the same time ensuring that it remains the main discourse through which environmental and developmental challenges are debated. The discursive character of sustainable development also makes it susceptible to multiple, contested and changing interpretations over time through the influence of a variety of domestic and international actors. Among the voices contributing to this dialogue are the growing number of international judicial bodies and arbitral tribunals that are increasingly being called upon to address disputes raising environmental and developmental issues. In this regard, this chapter is concerned not with the formal, legal status of sustainable development, but rather with broader questions about how judicial decisions may shape the meaning of sustainability as an environmental and developmental discourse, an enquiry that is attracting growing legitimacy. The chapter first examines the value that discourse theory can bring to understanding the judicial development of international law relating to sustainable development. It then turns to consider this process in the context of select cases relating to transboundary environmental disputes. The discussion hones in upon specific legal sub-discourses or narratives that have been influential in the resolution of disputes over natural resources, namely the notion that justice requires an equitable distribution of environmental goods, and that fair processes should accompany the making of environmental decisions. It is seen that these orthodox legal conceptions of equity and justice may be invoked for more than mere rhetorical reasons, and provide a language through which contemporary understandings of sustainable development may be accommodated within a formal legal framework. The due-process storyline is particularly important, demonstrating the growing international influence of domestic public law principles relating to transparency, accountability and participation in environmental decision-making.",

This guidance is used to facilitate evacuation route planning, post-disaster response and resource deployment, and critical infrastructure protection and securing, and it must be available within a time window in which decision makers can take appropriate action. This latter element is that which induces the need for urgency in this area. In this paper, we outline the North Carolina Forecasting System (NCFS) for storm surge and waves for coastal North Carolina, which is threatened by tropical cyclones about once every three years. We initially used advanced cyberinfrastructure techniques (e.g., opportunistic grid computing) in an effort to provide timely guidance for storm surge and wave impacts. However, our experience has been that a distributed computing approach is not robust enough to consistently produce the real-time results that end users expect. As a result, our technical approach has shifted so that the reliable and timely delivery of forecast products has been guaranteed by provisioning dedicated computational resources as opposed to relying on opportunistic availability of external resources. Our experiences with this forecasting effort is discussed in this paper, with a focus on Hurricane Irene (2011) that impacted a substantial portion of the US east coast from North Carolina, up along the eastern seaboard, and into New England. .",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are vulnerable to climate change impacts including sea level rise, invasive species, ocean acidification, changes in rainfall patterns, increased temperatures, and changing hazard regimes including hurricanes, floods and drought. Given high dependencies in Caribbean SIDS on natural resources for livelihoods, a focus on ecosystems and their interaction with people is essential for climate change adaptation. Increasingly, ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approaches are being highlighted as an approach to address climate change impacts. Specifically, EbA encourages the use of local and external knowledge about ecosystems to identify climate change adaptation approaches. This paper critically reviews EbA in Caribbean SIDS, focusing on the need to integrate local and external knowledge. An analysis of current EbA in the Caribbean is undertaken alongside a review of methodologies used to integrate local and external expertise for EbA. Finally key gaps, lessons learnt and suggested ways forward for EbA in Caribbean SIDS and potentially further afield are identified. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Enrolling over 30 million acres, the U.S. Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is the largest conservation program in the United States. Under the guidelines of the CRP, the federal government pays farmers to stop farming their land in the hopes of achieving a variety of conservation goals, including the reduction of soil erosion, improvement of water quality, and creation of wildlife habitat. In Conserving Data, James T. Hamilton explores the role of information in the policy cycle as it relates to the CRP. The author asks how the creation and distribution of information about what is going on across these millions of enrolled acres has influenced the development of the program itself. Of the many CRP stakeholders, each accesses a different set of information about the CRP?s operations. Regulators have developed the Environmental Benefits Index as a rough indicator of a field?s conservation benefits and adopted that measure as a way to determine which lands should be granted conservation contracts. NGOs have used publicly available data from these contracts to show how CRP monies are allocated. Members of Congress have used oversight hearings and GAO reports to monitor the Farm Service Agency?s conservation policy decisions. Reporters have localized the impact of the CRP by writing stories about increases in wildlife and hunting on CRP fields in their areas. Conserving Data brings together and analyzes these various streams of information, drawing upon original interviews with regulators, new data from Freedom of Information Act requests, and regulatory filings. Using the CRP as a launch point, Hamilton explores the role of information, including 'hidden information,' in the design and implementation of regulatory policy.",

Evidence indicates that the economic and social consequences of these policies have been so disastrous that there is now more poverty and more inequality than a generation ago. The same scenario is being proposed as the alternative to what has hitherto been labeled a social-democratic economic system in industrialized nations. The economically dominant minority has largely succeeded in imposing its neoliberal agenda by convincing the general public, through various means, of the need for austerity. The paper challenges the erroneous theories on which austerity is based and proposes an alternative explanation to what is the \u2018best practice\u2019 in public finance. It argues that deficit spending by the government is an important policy tool that can be successfully used to guarantee full employment and create wealth and prosperity for the whole society.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "In response to the growing importance of space exploration in future planning, the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) Panel on Exploration (PEX) was chartered to provide independent scientific advice to support the development of exploration programs and to safeguard the potential scientific assets of solar system objects. In this report, PEX elaborates a stepwise approach to achieve a new level of space cooperation that can help develop world-wide capabilities in space science and exploration and support a transition that will lead to a global space exploration program. The proposed stepping stones are intended to transcend cross-cultural barriers, leading to the development of technical interfaces and shared legal frameworks and fostering coordination and cooperation on a broad front. Input for this report was drawn from expertise provided by COSPAR Associates within the international community and via the contacts they maintain in various scientific entities. The report provides a summary and synthesis of science roadmaps and recommendations for planetary exploration produced by many national and international working groups, aiming to encourage and exploit synergies among similar programs. While science and technology represent the core and, often, the drivers for space exploration, several other disciplines and their stakeholders (Earth science, space law, and others) should be more robustly interlinked and involved than they have been to date. The report argues that a shared vision is crucial to this linkage, and to providing a direction that enables new countries and stakeholders to join and engage in the overall space exploration effort. Building a basic space technology capacity within a wider range of countries, ensuring new actors in space act responsibly, and increasing public awareness and engagement are concrete steps that can provide a broader interest in space exploration, worldwide, and build a solid basis for program sustainability. By engaging developing countries and emerging space nations in an international space exploration program, it will be possible to create a critical bottom-up support structure to support program continuity in the development and execution of future global space exploration frameworks. With a focus on stepping stones, COSPAR can support a global space exploration program that stimulates scientists in current and emerging spacefaring nations, and that will invite those in developing countries to participate - pursuing research aimed at answering outstanding questions about the origins and evolution of our solar system and life on Earth (and possibly elsewhere). COSPAR, in cooperation with national and international science foundations and space-related organizations, will advocate this stepping stone approach to enhance future cooperative space exploration efforts. .

The difference in the efficiency of using bacteria as an organic agent is that it could improve the durability of cement material. This study aimed to assess the use of biofilm-forming microorganisms as binding agents to increase the compressive strength of cement-sand material. We isolated 13 alkaliphilic biofilmforming bacteria (ABB) from a cement tetrapod block in the West Sea, Korea. Using 16S RNA sequence analysis, the ABB were partially identified as Bacillus algicola KNUC501 and Exiguobacterium marinum KNUC513. KNUC513 was selected for further study following analysis of pH and biofilm formation. Cement-sand mortar cubes containing KNUC513 exhibited greater compressive strength than mineral-forming bacteria (Sporosarcina pasteurii and Arthrobacter crystallopoietes KNUC403). To determine the biofilm effect, Dnase I was used to suppress the biofilm formation of KNUC513. Field emission scanning electron microscopy image revealed the direct involvement of organic-inorganic substance in cement-sand mortar.",

Results showed that the pipeline transport, electricity, and chemicals production stages represented the dominant contribution to environmental impact in most mid-point categories, whereas infrastructure, waste treatment, pipeline transport, and raw materials (e.g., straw, chemicals, coal, diesel) price played an important role to economic impact. Results indicate that it is very difficult to develop the technology of straw for biogas production in China in case without a national financial support. In addition, optimizing the efficiency of raw material consumption and decreasing the pipeline transport distance are effective way to decrease the both overall environmental and economic burden. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "At present, county level annual poverty rates for broad age groups at different poverty thresholds are not readily available. Unlike the 2000 census, the 2010 census did not collect income data to allow calculation of poverty rates, and future decennial censuses will not. Thus, there is a need for a method to estimate annual poverty rates at the county level. To fill in the existing gap, this paper develops a method conceptually similar to the regression-based modeling approach utilized for Census Bureau Small Area Estimates (SAIPE). This is applied to estimate and project the proportion of children less than 12. years of age whose income is below the 200% poverty threshold, by county in New York State from 2008 to 2010. Multiple regression techniques including random effects and Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models are applied. Data obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau, the American Community Survey and administrative sources are utilized. Administrative data sources adjust for, incorporate and model recent changes in the county economic situation. Finally, this paper contributes to the literature on county level relationships between poverty rates and income-based benefits, particularly on child care subsidies. Specifically, the association between the proportion of children receiving child care subsidies and child poverty rates vary by metropolitan, micropolitan and non-core-based designation of counties. .",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Objective Food insecurity is the limited or uncertain availability or access to nutritionally adequate, culturally appropriate and safe foods. Food insecurity may result in inadequate dietary intakes, overweight or obesity and the development of chronic disease. Internationally, few studies have focused on the range of potential health outcomes related to food insecurity among adults residing in disadvantaged locations and no such Australian studies exist. The objective of the present study was to investigate associations between food insecurity, sociodemographic and health factors and dietary intakes among adults residing in disadvantaged urban areas. Design Data were collected by mail survey (n 505, 53 % response rate), which ascertained information about food security status, demographic characteristics (such as age, gender, household income, education) fruit and vegetable intakes, takeaway and meat consumption, general health, depression and chronic disease. Setting Disadvantaged suburbs of Brisbane city, Australia, 2009. Subjects Individuals aged \u2265 20 years.Results Approximately one in four households (25 %) was food insecure. Food insecurity was associated with lower household income, poorer general health, increased health-care utilisation and depression. These associations remained after adjustment for age, gender and household income. Conclusions Food insecurity is prevalent in urbanised disadvantaged areas in developed countries such as Australia. Low-income households are at high risk of experiencing food insecurity. Food insecurity may result in significant health burdens among the population, and this may be concentrated in socio-economically disadvantaged suburbs. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Background: Significant gaps exist in the provision of surgical care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The purpose of this study was to develop a metric to monitor surgical capacity in LMICs. Methods: The World Health Organization developed a survey called the Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess Emergency and Essential Surgical Care. Using this tool, we developed a surgical capacity scoring index and assessed its usefulness with data from Sierra Leone, Liberia, and the Solomon Islands. Results: There were data from 10 hospitals in Sierra Leone, 16 hospitals in Liberia, and 9 hospitals in the Solomon Islands. The levels of surgical capacity were created using our scoring index based on a possible 100 points: level 1 for hospitals with <50 points, level 2 with 50-70 points, level 3 with 70-80 points, and level 4 with >80 points. In Sierra Leone, 44% of the hospitals had a surgical capacity rating of level 1, 50% level 2, and 10% level 3. In Liberia, 37.5% of the hospitals had a surgical capacity rating of level 1, 56.3% level 2, and only one hospital level 3. For Sierra Leone and Liberia, two factors-infrastructure and personnel-had the greatest deficits. In the Solomon Islands, 44.4% of the hospitals had their surgical capacity rated at level 1, 22.2% at level 2, 11.1% at level 3, and 22.2% at level 4. Conclusions: Pending pilot testing for reliability and validity, it appears that a systematic hospital surgical capacity index can identify areas for improvement and provide an objective measure for monitoring changes over time.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Consciousness of the specificities of childhood, as we know, has lasted for centuries. However, the history of childhood - in other words, the representation of it - should not be confounded with the history of the children in their everyday reality, although both influence each other. The history of the discoveries of childhood can, in fact, be interpreted as historically situated social constructions. And the myriad of eurekas that have punctuated the long history of childhood can be considered as a kaleidoscope that has reflected contrasted images of the projections by those who considered themselves as inventors of different faces of childhood. Occidental societies that have generalised education since the nineteenth century have largely disseminated the idea that childhood can be defined as a period specially dedicated to education and learning. In the first part of this paper, the huge phenomenon, with manifold consequences, of the transformation of the children into pupils - girls and boys - not, however, without discrimination, is analysed and contextualised. This phenomenon was accompanied by the appearance of a multitude of new specialists in childhood who scrutinised - as naturalists, experimentalists, social entrepreneurs, internationalist reformers - the conditions of children's development, of their learning and education. The kaleidoscope of images emanating from their observations and discourses is the object of the analysis presented in the second part of this paper. Three paradigmatic turning points or eurekas that materialise in a particularly significant way the theories, figures and places of such images have been chosen: (1) the spreading of evolutionist theory that invested the child as origin and future of humankind; (2) the pedological blaze that installed the science of the child as queen of the sciences; (3) the so-called Copernican revolution, as described by Clapar\u00e9de, that positioned the child - and not the pupil - as the centre around which pedagogy had to turn; consequently, with Piaget, the School of Geneva became a global reference of new theories of development. The analysis presented, based on a wide range of literature and on copious research in archives, led to putting forward the following thesis. Although many. emblematic representatives of this new science of the child studied the development of and were interested in childhood because of its evolutionary potentials and capacities for learning, they inclined in their theories to leave aside the questions of teaching and education. The social reality of the learning pupil was hidden in favour of a point of view heavily influenced by a sort of naturalism of the child, which postulated and stipulated that nature and its laws were inviolable and prominent. This naturalism was nourished both by a certain form of scientism based on the credo of the experimental approach and on a form of romanticism that regard as sacred this piece of nature supposedly intact that should be the prime state of childhood.

    "abstract_cleaned": "The global expansion of public-private partnerships (PPPs) has generated interest in establishing national PPP units for implementing or analyzing PPPs. Despite the good intentions for establishing such units, results have been mixed. Unless its role is clarified, a national PPP unit cannot be successful because it lacks adequate authority to respond appropriately to the changing environment. However, relevant research in construction journals is too limited to provide policymakers with constructive suggestions. This study aims to improve this situation by aligning a theoretical model with empirical data. The PPP activities can be analyzed as a game between the host government and private promoters trying to maximize their respective payoffs; thus, in accordance with new institutional economics (NIE) theory, a national PPP unit can be considered an endogenous equilibrium outcome of a game. On the basis of this perspective, three game (four consensus) theoretical models are constructed to find equilibriums: a single game for a single authority, repeated games for a single authority, and repeated games for government with multiple subordinate authorities. This study also uses a case study to present the history of PPPs in Taiwan and the evolutionary role of the National PPP Taskforce, Taiwan. National and international data confirm the theoretical model, which indicates that the common role of a national PPP unit is as a trust-creator between the public and private sectors. This pilot study contributes to the theoretical foundation that policymakers need to accelerate the learning process for implementing a PPP. It also provides researchers in the construction field with an NIE methodology for analyzing other governance structures in the construction field. ",

Despite its environmental significance, dissolved organic matter in natural form has never been studied using nuclear magnetic resonance based hydrodynamic radius measurements due to its extremely low concentration (e.g., a few mg/L) in natural waters. In this study, NMR-based hydrodynamic radius measurements were performed directly on unconcentrated pond, river, and sea waters. The key chemical components of the dissolved organic matters from different sources were identified as carbohydrates, carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules, and aliphatic molecules.

    "abstract_cleaned": "The interface areas between marine and terrestrial environments encompasses some of the most exploited and vulnerable ecosystems in the world. How these transitional environments can be effectively planned and managed has led to the creation of new planning instruments. Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) has been widely promoted as a potential mechanism for effective and integrated planning and management of these areas. However achieving the aspirations for ICZM is complex not least because of the many human activities and diverse regulatory regimes that exist in coastal areas, whose interest and concerns must be effective integrated into a single policy and implementation regime. Within the context of the developing world countries there have been few critical and analytical evaluations of why ICZM experiments have failed. This paper seeks to begin to address this gap by suggesting that Actor Network Theory (ANT) is an appropriate analytical framework to critically evaluate why ICZM initiatives in Egypt, at both the national and local level, have been relatively unsuccessful. The critical evaluation leads to some practical recommendations that could help to enhance the implementation of ICZM in Egypt and other developing countries. .",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Anaerobic methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) degradation potential was investigated in samples from a range of sources. From these 22 experimental variations, only one source (from wastewater treatment plant samples) exhibited MTBE degradation. These microcosms were methanogenic and were subjected to DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP) targeted to both bacteria and archaea to identify the putative MTBE degraders. For this purpose, DNA was extracted at two time points, subjected to ultracentrifugation, fractioning, and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP). In addition, bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed. The SIP experiments indicated bacteria in the phyla Firmicutes (family Ruminococcaceae) and Alphaproteobacteria (genus Sphingopyxis) were the dominant MTBE degraders. Previous studies have suggested a role for Firmicutes in anaerobic MTBE degradation; however, the putative MTBE-degrading microorganism in the current study is a novel MTBE-degrading phylotype within this phylum. Two archaeal phylotypes (genera Methanosarcina and Methanocorpusculum) were also enriched in the heavy fractions, and these organisms may be responsible for minor amounts of MTBE degradation or for the uptake of metabolites released from the primary MTBE degraders. Currently, limited information exists on the microorganisms able to degrade MTBE under anaerobic conditions. This work represents the first application of DNA-based SIP to identify anaerobic MTBE-degrading microorganisms in laboratory microcosms and therefore provides a valuable set of data to definitively link identity with anaerobic MTBE degradation.

    "title": "Land use change and soil organic carbon dynamics in Mediterranean agro-ecosystems: The case study of Pianosa Island",
    "abstract_cleaned": "In agro-ecosystems, land use change and the associated management practices exert a strong impact on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock variation. SOC dynamics are generally not linear and several years are required to reach a new equilibrium. Consequently, short-term assessments may be inadequate to represent these dynamics while long-term datasets are often scarce to derive rates of change. In this context, the integration of different methodologies appears to be an interesting approach to improve the capacity for predicting SOC evolution under human induced and climate drivers. The Island of Pianosa (Tuscan Archipelago, Italy) is an interesting case study for SOC evolution related to land use change, as it was intensively cultivated for several centuries and completely abandoned since the end of the 1990s. This paper presents seven years of carbon flux measurements from the typical abandoned Mediterranean ecosystem of Pianosa. These measurements are also integrated into a modeling framework, with soil sampling and historical information, to assess the past and predicted SOC evolution in relation to land use change. Results show that the abandoned ecosystem was able to rapidly recover the SOC depleted during agricultural exploitation, increasing SOC content by about 30% above the 1990s value. The model simulations, forced by the Had3_A1Fi climatic scenario, predicted an increasing SOC sequestration until the middle of this century under unmanaged conditions. However, re-cultivation of these soils may potentially cause a SOC loss ranging from 4.1 to 5.8kg C m -2 in 90years, if appropriate soil conservation management practices are not implemented. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Navigation, especially in unknown areas, remains a major problem for the visually impaired (VI). Over the past 50 years, a number of electronic travel aids (ETAs) have been developed with the aim of improving the mobility of the VI. Despite the efforts, these systems are rarely used. Although the explanation is likely to be incomplete, it is possible to identify three important factors: (1) positioning accuracy provided by these devices is not sufficient to guide a VI pedestrian, (2) these systems are based on Geographical Information Systems not adapted to pedestrian mobility, and (3) the guidance methods should be adapted to the task of pedestrian navigation. The NAVIG project aims to answer all these limitations through a participatory design framework with the VI and orientation and mobility instructors. The NAVIG device aims to complement conventional mobility aids (i.e. white cane and guide dog), while also adding unique features to localize specific objects in the environment, restore some visuomotor abilities, and assist navigation.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Background: In light of the HIV pandemic, significant strides have been made in improving treatment options for patients. Technologies to monitor the progress of a patient on such treatment have therefore also been scaled up. Immune activation as measured by CD38 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) on CD8 T cells has been successfully shown in a clinical trial to predict response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and reported as a cost effective real time test to supplement more costly VL testing. In this study we report transfer of this technology from the research into the routine environment. Methods: This study was conducted in 2 parts: Firstly, fresh random samples (n = 75) were tested at four time intervals (0, 24, 36 and 48. h) post-venesection to review reproducibility of CD38 MFI expression. Secondly, the CD38 MFI assay was introduced into a pilot regional testing facility and random samples (n = 40) were validated against values obtained on matched samples tested at the reference laboratory. Results: The CD38 assay showed acceptable accuracy and reproducibility up to 36. h (98% similarity) after venesection with some reduction in CD38 MFI to 94% at 48. h (bias < 0.2MFI, %CV < 5).Implementation at the secondary testing site was successful with 98% similarity (% SIM CV < 5%) compared to the reference laboratory. Conclusion: The assay proved stable over time and could be tested until 48. h after venesection with no loss of CD38 MFI. Off-site implementation also proved successful, as such, the CD38 assay offers a reliable real time supplementary test to long-term VL monitoring of HIV infected patients on the national ART programme.

    "abstract_cleaned": "China Investment Corporation (CIC) transformed its initial investment strategy of focusing mainly on the US financial sector during 2007-2008 into a new strategy of diversified investments across geography and sectors since 2009. Massive financial losses and domestic political backlash during the global financial crisis of 2008 gave impetus to CIC's rethinking of strategy. In the midst of the crisis, CIC engineered a capacity-building and reorganization exercise to reposition itself for a new strategy that has since allowed for more diversification of investments. A more receptive global investment climate for sovereign wealth funds has also aided CIC's efforts to present itself as a responsible global investor and facilitated its investments. Postcrisis, CIC's new strategy of diversification is characterized by continued investments in the financial sector, but with new investments increasingly directed to real sectors of energy, natural resources, and real estate in both developed and emerging economies. Notwithstanding a global recovery that is fraught with uncertainties, CIC's judicious timing in making diversified investments, and its attention to reducing risks and enhancing returns, have been rewarded by an impressive turnaround in performance since 2009. Going forward, the success and sustainability of the new strategy will be contingent on how well CIC can navigate domestic bureaucratic rivalry and the shifting climate of the international investment environment in the medium to long term. Ultimately, CIC's shareholder, the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC), holds the key to its future direction and goals. ",

Country-level time series data of energy consumption and economic growth are pooled and used to estimate the model. Sub-Saharan African countries in the sample are classified into low income and middle income countries. The findings support the neutrality hypothesis in the short-run, except for middle income countries, and a strong causation running in both directions is found in the long-run. The different results for low and middle income countries provide evidence of the importance of income level in the causal relationship. This study helps to explain the interdependence of energy consumption and economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. Results are critical in formulating sustainable development policies that are geared to the efficient allocation of resources which are expected to increase access to energy services in the study region.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Traditional policies for water resources management and wetland conservation are often based on command-and-control approaches. The latter tend to drive the human-wetland-water system into pathological states, characterized by more vulnerable ecosystems and rigid institutions for governance. The overcoming of these states may rest in the development of flexible and adaptive institutional regimes that rely on adaptive governance and management. Because past factors might constrain the implementation of more flexible adaptive approaches to management, it is important to understand the historical mechanisms underlying the genesis of institutional rigidity. We first present the results of a historical analysis of Do\u00f1ana, which can be characterized as a pathological water socio-ecosystem governed through rigid institutional regimes for water resources management and wetland conservation. In a second step, we analyze the advances achieved during a recent, large-scale restoration program for the Do\u00f1ana wetlands, which adhered explicitly to the tenets of adaptive management. Our analysis indicated that the historical persistence of command-and-control approaches has been a path-dependent process that led to the emergence of a rigid institutional regime and caused it to enter a rigidity trap. However, the achievements of the restoration program suggest that a more flexible and adaptive regime could be developed through the introduction of adaptive management at the operational levels, using specifically tailored action research programs. To conclude, we speculate that the research strategy outlined could be extended to comply with, or complement, the requirements of the EU's Water Framework Directive in other European water socio-ecosystems.

    "title": "Women who migrate, men who wait: Eritrean labor migration to the Arab Near East",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Over the last five decades, Eritrea has experienced a massive outflow of labor migrants to the Arab Near East. Although this labor migration has grown steadily since the 1950s, there has been a profound change in the magnitude and dynamism of the migration since the early 1970s. The reason is that Eritrea has suffered from severe economic problems resulting from its three-decade-long war of liberation with Ethiopia. By contrast, the Arab Near East, the oil-producing countries in particular, have enjoyed a significant increase in their wealth as a result of a sharp rise in energy prices following the world energy crises in 1973 and 1979. With the accumulation of wealth, these countries engaged in large-scale restructuring and development programs that created chronic labor shortages. This great contrast in the wealth and size of the labor force resulted in a pronounced difference in the rewards for employment between Eritrea and the Arab Near East. This difference has attracted a large number of Eritrean labor migrants to countries like Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, and the United Arab Emirates. This article examines the labor market patterns and the cultural effects on economic behavior, and investigates to what extent earnings and remittances and therefore the income of women migrants are impacted by cultural variables. It also reveals that women are likely to take up domestic work when they migrate to various destinations in the Arab Near East, that such women were unemployed prior to their migration, and that the earnings of women, are, on average, lower than those of men, but that women send more money back home than do men. These higher rates of remittances by women are not simply expressions of income and expenditure but are rather attributable to higher savings abilities embedded in cultural values. In sum, the article looks at the dynamics of household labor in the context of migration; discusses paid household work as a structural continuation of unpaid household work across the public sphere; demonstrates how Eritrean women travel through the household worker/housewife boundary in their home country and become family breadwinners, men's supporters, sources of funding for state projects, and urban property owners by engaging in household work; and underscores women's agency by articulating their paid household work through the negotiation of the monetary and emotional value of their labor in the Arab Near East.

    "title": "Diverse migration strategy between freshwater and seawater habitats in the freshwater eel genus Anguilla",
    "abstract_cleaned": "The freshwater eels of the genus Anguilla, which are catadromous, migrate between freshwater growth habitats and offshore spawning areas. A number of recent studies, however, found examples of the temperate species Anguilla anguilla, Anguilla rostrata, Anguilla japonica, Anguilla australis and Anguilla dieffenbachii that have never migrated into fresh water, spending their entire life history in the ocean. Furthermore, those studies found an intermediate type between marine and freshwater residents, which appear to frequently move between different environments during their growth phase. The discovery of marine and brackish-water residents Anguilla spp. suggests that they do not all have to be catadromous, and it calls into question the generalized classification of diadromous fishes. There has been little available information, however, concerning migration in tropical Anguilla spp. Anguilla marmorata, shows three fluctuation patterns: (1) continuous residence in fresh water, (2) continuous residence in brackish water and (3) residence in fresh water after recruitment, while returning to brackish water. Such migratory patterns were found in other tropical species, Anguilla bicolor bicolor and Anguilla bicolor pacifica. In A. b. bicolor collected in a coastal lagoon of Indonesia, two further patterns of habitat use were found: (1) constantly living in either brackish water or sea water with no freshwater life and (2) habitat shift from fresh water to brackish water or sea water. The wide range of environmental habitat use indicates that migratory behaviour of tropical Anguilla spp. is facultative among fresh, brackish and marine waters during their growth phases after recruitment to the coastal areas. Further, the migratory behaviours of tropical Anguilla spp. appear to differ in each habitat in response to inter and intra-specific competition. The results suggest that tropical Anguilla spp. have a flexible pattern of migration, with an ability to adapt to various habitats and salinities. The ability of anguillids to reside in environments of various salinities would be a common feature between tropical and temperate species without a latitudinal cline. Thus, the migration of Anguilla spp. into fresh water is clearly not an obligatory behaviour. This evidence of geographical variability among Anguilla spp. suggests that habitat use is determined by environmental conditions in each site.  Journal of Fish Biology ",

One of the main reasons for concern is the possible effect of EDCs on human health. EDCs may be released into the environment in different ways, and one of the most significant sources is industrial wastewater. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the treatment performance of different wastewater treatment procedures (biological treatment, filtration, advanced oxidation processes) for the reduction of chemical oxygen demand and seven selected EDCs (dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, benzyl butyl phthalate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, bisphenol A and nonylphenol) from wastewaters from a mill producing 100 % recycled paper. Two pilot plants were running in parallel and the following treatments were compared: (i) anaerobic biological treatment followed by aerobic biological treatment, ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis (RO), and (ii) anaerobic biological treatment followed by membrane bioreactor and RO. Moreover, at lab-scale, four different advanced oxidation processes (Fenton reaction, photo-Fenton reaction, photocatalysis with TiO2, and ozonation) were applied. The results indicated that the concentrations of selected EDCs from paper mill wastewaters were effectively reduced (100 %) by both combinations of pilot plants and photo-Fenton oxidation (98 %), while Fenton process, photocatalysis with TiO2 and ozonation were less effective (70 % to 90 %, respectively).

    "title": "Anthropogenic harvesting pressure and changes in life history: Insights from a rocky intertidal limpet",
    "abstract_cleaned": "The importance of large breeding individuals for maintaining the health of marine fish and invertebrate populations has long been recognized. Unfortunately, decades of human harvesting that preferentially remove larger individuals have led to drastic reductions in body sizes of many of these species. Such size-selective harvesting is particularly worrisome for sequentially hermaphroditic species where the larger size classes are composed primarily of one sex. Whether these species can maintain stable sex ratios under sustained harvesting pressure depends on the level of plasticity of their life-history traits. Here, we show that populations of a marine limpet (Lottia gigantea) can adjust a fundamental aspect of their life history (the timing of sex change) when subjected to size-selective harvesting. As predicted by theoretical models, individuals from harvested populations change sex at smaller sizes and grow at slower rates compared to individuals from protected populations. In addition, the relative size at which the change from male to female occurs remains constant (\u223c0.75; size at sex change/maximum size) across populations, regardless of harvesting pressure. Our results show that populationlevel demographic and life-history data, in conjunction with existing theory, can be sufficient to predict the responses of sequential hermaphrodites to harvesting pressure. Furthermore, they suggest such species can potentially adapt to size-selective harvesting. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "This article discusses the current debate between populist and republican accounts of democracy. To talk about democracy is inevitably to talk about the idea of a people and its power. From the beginnings of the Western political tradition, the people has referred to both a constituted part of society (populus) and to a part excluded from political society (plebs). The article examines the differences between populism and republicanism in light of the different ways in which these two parts relate to each other, and the resulting conceptions of the power of the people. For populism, the people have power when the plebs achieves hegemony within the populus by wresting control of the state from the wealthy elites. According to the alternative republican account developed in this article, instead, the people have power when the plebs inscribes within the state the possibility of abolishing relations of rule. The distinction between these two conceptions of popular power is pursued in terms of the opposing attitudes that populism and republicanism have in relation to the rule of law. The article also raises a hypothesis as to the historical reasons for these distinctions between populism and republicanism by examining three historical moments, which are crucial for the development of plebeian politics: the early Roman republic, the Augustinian foundation of a Christian republic and the crisis of guild republicanism in Machiavelli's age. .",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Public housing redevelopment in the United States is virtually synonymous with the HOPE VI program, through which the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has transformed over 250 housing projects into mixed-income communities. However, the overall the extent of public housing redevelopment has far exceeded the original mandate of HOPE VI due to the expansion of Demolition/Disposition activities facilitated by the program. The permissiveness of such activities has resulted in the replacement of housing projects with luxury condominiums, shopping and convention centers, and other land uses unrelated to affordable housing. In the process, over 210,000 housing units guaranteed to be affordable to low-income households have been removed from the country's public housing inventory. This article investigates the foundations, the overall scope, and the characteristics of Demolition/Disposition activities beyond the purview of HOPE VI, and discusses their implications for the uncertain future of public housing in the U. S. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Aim Modern biodiversity peaks in the tropics and declines poleward, a pattern that is potentially driven by climate. Although this latitudinal biodiversity gradient (LBG) also characterizes the marine invertebrate fossil record, distributions of ancient terrestrial faunas are poorly understood. This study utilizes data on the dinosaur fossil record to examine spatial patterns in terrestrial biodiversity throughout the Mesozoic. Location We compiled data on fossil occurrences across the globe. Methods We compiled a comprehensive dataset of Mesozoic dinosaur genera (738), including birds. Following the utilization of sampling standardization techniques to mediate for the uneven sampling of the fossil record, we constructed latitudinal patterns of biodiversity from this dataset. Results The dominant group of Mesozoic terrestrial vertebrates did not conform to the modern LBG. Instead, dinosaur diversity was highest at temperate palaeolatitudes throughout the 160 million year span of dinosaurian evolutionary history. Latitudinal diversity correlates strongly with the distribution of land area. Late Cretaceous sauropods and ornithischians exhibit disparate LBGs. Main conclusions The continuity of the palaeotemperate peak in dinosaur diversity indicates a diminished role for climate on the Mesozoic LBG; instead, dinosaur diversity may have been driven by the amount of land area among latitudinal belts. There is no evidence that the tropics acted as a cradle for dinosaur diversity. Geographical partitioning among major clades of herbivorous dinosaurs in the Late Cretaceous may result from the advanced stages of continental fragmentation and/or differing responses to increasing latitudinal climatic zonation. Our results suggest that the modern-day LBG on land was only established 30 million years ago, following a significant post-Eocene recalibration, potentially related to increased seasonality. .",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Prevention efforts to combat pine wilt disease must be instituted to avoid destruction of coastal forests in Hokkaido, northern Japan. We examine an alternative method involving the conversion of Pinus thunbergii forests to native broadleaf species through advancing their growth, but we have little knowledge about the response of advanced growth to overhead canopy release. To demonstrate the demographic and height growth response of advanced growth to the light change in a coastal Pinus thunbergii forest, canopy trees were removed and the sapling populations were monitored for 6 years. Inhibition in height growth caused by light increase was observed in Cerasus sargentii and Kalopanax septemlobus saplings. Especially in Kalopanax septemlobus, a remarkable decline was observed in the saplings growing in the darker positions which experienced light change. Therefore, large light changes should be carefully avoided for this species especially in the darker positions. In contrast, relative height growth rates of Quercus crispula and, especially, Quercus dentata increased with increasing light, and saplings tended to die in the darker positions. No dead trees of Sorbus commixta were observed during the study period. The saplings also showed good height growth even when under closed canopy. This species seems to be adaptive to a dark environment. Since Quercus dentata and Kalopanax septemlobus are the major components of the natural coastal forests in Hokkaido, gradual canopy release is available to foster advanced growth in coastal Pinus thunbergii forest, in accordance with the concept of density control in coastal forests.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Constructed wetlands, as an ecological restoration technology, have been widely applied to deal with the degradation of natural wetlands and the pollution of water bodies, and more attention should be focused on the system stability and maintenance of functions over the long term. A Comprehensive Index System can be applied to perform an overall evaluation of an ecosystem through many different indices from different aspects and the Analytic Hierarchy Process is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions particularly in group decision making. Based on the Comprehensive Index System and Analytic Hierarchy Process, we presented a measure method to evaluate the eco - sustainability of large-scale constructed wetlands,which are constructed for water purification and offsetting the degradation of natural wetlands. The index system contains three criteria: ecological structures and functions, water purification capability, and economic-social functions, and then fourteen sub-criteria including biodiversity, primary production, resistance to ecological invasion, wildlife habitats provision, COD removal, ammonia nitrogen removal, total nitrogen removal, total phosphorus removal, siltation, wetland plants harvest, operation costs, wetland plants benefits, recreation benefits and public awareness of the value of the wetlands. The weight of each criterion and sub-criterion is determined by the results of expert questionnaires. Five levels including very good, good, average, bad and very badare established to determine the sustainability of constructed wetland with the listed continuity intervals [1. 0-0. 8, 0. 8-0. 6, 0. 6-0. 4, 0. 4-0. 2, 0. 2-0. 0]. A case study based on the index system was conducted in a five-stage surface-flow constructed wetland, which was built in the Xinxue River estuary by Nansi Lake to improve the water quality and to make up for the degradation of riparian wetlands. The calculated results of the weight of each criterion and sub criterion showed that ecological structures and functionsand water purification capabilityaccount for 40. 17% and 42. 94% of the weight respectively, while biodiversity, ammonia nitrogen removal, resistance to ecological invasion, wildlife habitats provision, and COD removal are the main factors in the sub-criteria influencing the sustainability of the Xinxue River constructed wetland. According to the eco-sustainability evaluation, the eco-sustainability of the Xinxue River constructed wetland is at a 'good'level (0. 6862) on the whole, and specifically the ecological structure and functions (0. 7732), water purification capability (0. 6190) and social-economic functions (0. 6492) are all at a 'good' level, although the biodiversity index is 0. 5200, which means the biodiversity of the Xinxue River constructed wetland is still lower than that of the natural wetland surrounding Nansi Lake, which also reflects the conflicts between ecosystem functions and structures in constructed wetlands. The index of benefits from the wetland plants is also in a badlevel because the annual biomass of Xinxue River constructed wetland is kept in the wetland according to the local laws and regulations instead of being developed into commercial products. In conclusion, the further improvement for Xinxue River constructed wetland should focus on the extension of economic and social functions: development of wetland ecotourism should be exploited and the technological innovations of wetland plants processing should be enhanced to promote sustainable development of the local economy. The index system suggested here can also be adopted to evaluate other similar large-scale constructed wetlands.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Previous research on gender-based economic inequality has emphasized occupational segregation as the leading explanatory factor for the gender wage gap. Yet the globalization of the U.S. economy has affected gender inequality in fundamental ways and potentially diminished the influence of occupational gender segregation. We examine whether occupational gender segregation continues to be the main determinant of gender earnings inequality and to what extent globalization processes have emerged as important determinants of inequality between women's and men's earnings. We study factors contributing to the gender earnings ratio as well as the median earnings of men and women for 271 U.S. metropolitan areas. The results indicate that occupational segregation is still the leading determinant of gender earnings inequality, that its effects are only slightly diminished by the presence of globalization, and that various aspects of the global economy independently influence the gender earnings gap.

This article explores the significance of alpine tourism in the Mt Kenya region based on analysis of the state of the art and official statistical data along with own surveys, mapping activities, and household observations. The results show that economic benefits from mountaineering tourism in the Mt Kenya region are smaller than commonly calculated, and that low and inconsistent incomes are distributed unevenly. There are clear parallels to the critical situation in the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda: Alpine tourism does not reduce regional income disparities and largely fails to promote sustainable development. The article also takes a closer look at the development effects of community-based tourism, drawing from the example of the Mt Kenya Guides and Porters Safari Club (GPSC), a community-based tourism organization operating from Naro Moru, at the fertile western foot of Mt Kenya. Results show that this form of tourism stabilizes the livelihoods of rural households, contributes to community welfare, and reduces the vulnerability of families. The GPSC's democratic organizational structure with elected and regularly rotating offices prevents the enrichment of only few members and ensures even distribution of benefits to all members and to the whole community. Overall, however, there is not enough tourism in the study area to initiate sustainable regional development in the foreseeable future. ",

However, this leads to a heavier mechanical design, which means a high material cost during wind turbine manufacturing. Therefore, lightweight design of a wind turbine is an important design constraint. Usually, a lightweight mechanical structure has low damping. Therefore, if it is subjected to a disturbance, it will oscillate continuously. This study deals with the active damping control of a wind turbine tower. An algorithm that mitigates the mechanical loads of a wind turbine tower is introduced. The effectiveness of this algorithm is verified through a numerical simulation using GH Bladed, which is a commercial aero-elastic code for wind turbines. ",

Sampling, storage, and pretreatment techniques are briefly overviewed, including the significance of systematic errors that cannot be corrected later on. The main techniques in this article are electrothermal-atomic absorption spectrometry (ET-AAS), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and voltammetry. Flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) are treated as well, although their limits of quantification are not sufficient for a determination of lead in unpolluted seawater. Even when separation and preconcentration techniques are applied, these techniques are only capable of detecting lead in polluted coastal seawater. Separation and preconcentration are actually also required for ET-AAS and ICP-MS in order to determine the lowest concentrations of lead found in unpolluted open-ocean seawater, which is still a challenge for the analytical chemist.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Thorne, K.M.; Takekawa, J.Y., and Elliott-Fisk, D.L., 2012. Ecological effects of climate change on salt marsh wildlife: A case study from a highly urbanized estuary. Coastal areas are high-risk zones subject to the impacts of global climate change, with significant increases in the frequencies of extreme weather and storm events, and sea-level rise forecast by 2100. These physical processes are expected to alter estuaries, resulting in loss of intertidal wetlands and their component wildlife species. In particular, impacts to salt marshes and their wildlife will vary both temporally and spatially and may be irreversible and severe. Synergistic effects caused by combining stressors with anthropogenic land-use patterns could create areas of significant biodiversity loss and extinction, especially in urbanized estuaries that are already heavily degraded. In this paper, we discuss current ideas, challenges, and concerns regarding the maintenance of salt marshes and their resident wildlife in light of future climate conditions. We suggest that many salt marsh habitats are already impaired and are located where upslope transgression is restricted, resulting in reduction and loss of these habitats in the future. In addition, we conclude that increased inundation frequency and water depth will have negative impacts on the demography of small or isolated wildlife meta-populations as well as their community interactions. We illustrate our points with a case study on the Pacific Coast of North America at San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge in California, an area that supports endangered wildlife species reliant on salt marshes for all aspects of their life histories.

The model was validated with the observed groundwater level and salinity data. The impact of various water management scenarios on the groundwater levels has been analyzed through the model. The study revealed that, on average, the water table is rising under the existing conditions, although at a slow rate. To prevent the area from further salinization, some recommendations have been made: change the cropping pattern with reduced rice area; increase the groundwater abstraction, and line the surface irrigation systems. It was concluded from the analysis of various scenarios that simultaneously implementing multiple approaches is more effective in controlling waterlogging problems than individual interventions. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "A new theory for formation of flint in the North Sea Danian Ekofisk Formation chalk has been formulated, according to which the flint formed by sedimentation of nano-size \u03b1-quartz particles. These \u03b1-quartz particles have crystallized in the sea from silicon supplied from dissolution of radiolarians. In the present work this model has been tested by sedimentological and mineralogical investigation of sedimentary features in chalk containing silica. Methods applied are X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermal analysis (DTA-EGA). In the Ekofisk Formation, silica was present in flint, in quartz beds, and as quartz particles dispersed in the chalk. The quartz in the flint, in the quartz intervals and the quartz particles in the chalk are one and the same kind of quartz. It is composed of 0.1-0.3 \u03bcm spheres of \u03b1-quartz having perfect three-dimensional order but with slightly larger cell dimensions compared to standard \u03b1-quartz. The quartz in the flint, in the quartz horizons and dispersed in the chalk must accordingly have formed by one and the same mechanism, which is crystallization in the water phase prior to sedimentation. It is proposed that the difference in proportion of calcite in the flint and the quartz horizons on one side and the chalk with quartz particles on the other is due to different degrees of dissolution of the pelagic skeletal debris of coccolithophorids in the seawater during sedimentation. This variation is attributed to differences in concentration of CO 2 in the seawater, and the high amounts of CO 2 dissolving the calcite during sedimentation of the pure quartz are proposed to come from volcanic activity. This implies that the quartz-rich horizons (consisting of dispersed quartz, quartz horizons, or flint) are regional features and may as such be present as regional sheets in the pelagic Danian Ekofisk chalk reservoir. .",

The fresh cheese environment was modelled in Brain Heart Infusion Broth media and food matrices (pasteurized milk from retail outlets) by internal and external factors (pH = 4.5 and 5.5, 2% NaCl, and t = 8 \u00b0C and 15 \u00b0C). The counts of enterotoxigenic strains of S. aureus at baseline, i.e. at the time of inoculation of model samples, corresponded to those encountered in the production of fresh cheeses as a result of post-pasteurization contamination. Enumeration of S. aureus was performed in accordance with EN ISO 6888-1, using agar medium. Staphylococcal enterotoxins were detected by the enzyme-linked fuorescence assay. The pH (4.5) and refrigeration temperature (8 \u00b0C) used prevented S. aureus from achieving the critical count of 105 cfu\u00b7ml-1 specifed in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2073/2005. The highest rates of enterotoxin production were recorded for enterotoxin A. The growth curves of S. aureus derived from model experiments were compared with the growth curve generated by a predictive microbiology program - Pathogen Modelling Program. The results of this study proved the Pathogen Modelling Program to be suitable for use in the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points system in the process of the fresh cheese production to help manufacturers prevent the growth of S. aureus and enterotoxin production.",

A certain spatial variability was also observed, possibly related to the shelter conditions of different marsh sub-habitats (e.g. marsh creeks vs. adjacent mudflats). These results were discussed in the light of the available ecological knowledge on the two species, with a particular attention to the conservation priority focused on the protection of biodiversity and of key habitats. .",

    "title": "Assessing the development of rehabilitated grasslands on post-mined landforms in north west Queensland, Australia",
    "abstract_cleaned": "The Ernest Henry Mine in north west Queensland, Australia, is required to return disturbed land to native grassland and has been undertaking extensive revegetation of waste rock dumps since 2002. To ascertain the trajectories for revegetation success of these rehabilitated native grasslands, annual vegetation monitoring of both rehabilitation sites and selected reference areas has been undertaken since 2007. Long-term monitoring efforts have included assessments of vegetation composition, ecological structure and function at four rehabilitation areas (1-7 years post-rehabilitation) and proximal reference sites within surrounding grazed and ungrazed agro-ecosystems, undisturbed by mining. Our findings demonstrated that the oldest rehabilitated sites had similar species composition and functional elements to selected reference sites, although plant cover and biomass (particularly of native grasses) was lower than both grazed and ungrazed reference areas. The youngest sites had little established vegetation, however species richness was similar to the reference sites and functional life forms were present despite being in very low abundance. It is suggested that future monitoring events and informed management inputs (which consider local climatic conditions and soil fertility factors) could contribute to the development of a stable and sustainable native grassland thus achieving the desired end land use on these post-industrial landscapes.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Following Levins' patch occupancy model, we presented a differential-equation model, in which both the metapopulation dynamics and the dynamics of the fraction of suitable patches in the habitat are characterized. Habitat restoration induced by organism itself (internal restoration) and by other organisms or/and abiotic causes (external restoration) were incorporated in the model, together with habitat destruction. Stability analysis revealed the existence of alternative equilibriums (i.e., bi-stability) in the system. The internal restoration of habitat was identified as the trigger for the bi-stability, whereas the external restoration, in contrast, can eliminate the bi-stability from the system. The results, thus, emphasize the important role of the organism-environment feedback in biological conservation. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Sustainable forest management (SFM), an explicit policy objective in Canada, balances social, economic and environmental values. The status and trends of forest-associated species is one indicator of SFM, though it is under utilized due to challenges with indicator selection and data availability. This paper demonstrates and tests an indicator selection methodology which combines Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data and LandSat land cover data to identify indicator guilds, or groups of indicator species, for a series of forest composition and configuration attributes in the Great Lakes St. Lawrence forest region. Guild performance is tested at independent sites within the region and compared with that of guilds assembled using known species' habitat preferences, and abundance trends are reported for two periods: 1990-2007 and 1967-2007. Guilds assembled using the method proposed here describe more variation in forest composition (r-sq(adj): 41-76) than those assembled using known habitat preferences alone (r-sq(adj): 17-58). Forest configuration guilds, which were not compared with existing guilds, also describe a large proportion of variation in configuration attributes (r-sq(adj): 47-76). Guild abundance remained stable over the long and short term for most guilds with the exception of the wetland guild, which increased moderately over the long-term, and the deciduous guild which increased moderately over the short-term. Despite challenges associated with the use of bird guilds as indicators of forest composition and configuration, results presented here suggest that indicator guilds may provide useful information regarding the status and trends of regional scale forest composition and configuration attributes. .

Student accounts are placed within the context of a wide variety of primary and secondary sources from across Britain and the world, making this project the first book-length history of the British student movement to employ literary and theoretical frameworks which differentiate it from most other histories of student activism to date. Globalization, especially of mass communications, made British students aware of global problems such as the threat of nuclear weapons, the Vietnam War, racism, sexism and injustice. British students applied these global ideas to their own unique circumstances, using their intellectual traditions and political theories which resulted in unique outcomes. British student activists effectively gained support from students, staff, and workers for their struggle for student's rights to unionize, freely assemble and speak, and participate in university decision-making. Their campaigns effectively raised public awareness of these issues and contributed to significant national decisions in many considerable areas.  All rights reserved.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "In northern Morocco are located most of the dams and reservoirs of the country, while this region is affected by severe rainfall events causing floods. To improve the management of the water regulation structures, there is a need to develop rainfall-runoff models to both maximize the storage capacity and reduce the risks caused by floods. In this study, a model is developed to reproduce the flood events for a 655 km2 catchment located upstream of the 6th largest dam in Morocco. Constrained by data availability, a standard event-based model combining a SCS-CN (Soil Conservation Service Curve Number) loss model and a Clark unit hydrograph was developed for hourly discharge simulation using 16 flood events that occurred between 1984 and 2008. The model was found satisfactory to reproduce the runoff and the temporal evolution of floods, even with limited rainfall data. Several antecedent wetness conditions estimators for the catchment were compared with the initial condition of the model. Theses estimators include an antecedent discharge index, an antecedent precipitation index and a continuous daily soil moisture accounting model (SMA), based on precipitation and evapotranspiration. The SMA model performed the best to estimate the initial conditions of the event-based hydrological model (<i>R</i>2 Combining double low line 0.9). Its daily output has been compared with ASCAT and AMSR-E remote sensing data products, which were both able to reproduce with accuracy the daily simulated soil moisture dynamics at the catchment scale. This same approach could be implemented in other catchments of this region for operational purposes. The Results of this study suggest that remote sensing data are potentially useful to estimate the soil moisture conditions in the case of ungauged catchments in Northern Africa. ",

In a comprehensive and comparative fashion, the contents herein give credence to a developing nation that demonstrates expedience and emphasizes a history of continuity with remarkable results. Underlying the report is a journey that enlightens the reader to a process rich in application and outcome during a period in which the plague of HIV has transformed the Caribbean and Latin America community. Meanwhile, it also speaks to a collaborative effort inclusive of government, medical agencies, laboratories, international organizations and the public toward a common good. The country, nonetheless, is not without its shortcomings and therefore monetary constraints and matters of confidentiality and discrimination are pivotal to the presentation. In fact, an elaborate characterization accentuates a 50-year old commercial interdiction as a deterrent that contributes to the disruption of affordability and accessibility to the exchange of goods, services and information. Against all likelihood, a contrasting analysis of regional states inclusive of the United States of America documents Cuba's astonishing success in restricting HIV/AIDS. The Cuban model as described is an exemplary work in progress but likewise the fulfilment of the socialist philosophy toward humanity.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "A full-scale oxidation ditch process for treating sewage was simulated with the ASM2d model and optimized for minimal cost with acceptable performance in terms of ammonium and phosphorus removal. A unified index was introduced by integrating operational costs (aeration energy and sludge production) with effluent violations for performance evaluation. Scenario analysis showed that, in comparison with the baseline (all of the 9 aerators activated), the strategy of activating 5 aerators could save aeration energy significantly with an ammonium violation below 10%. Sludge discharge scenario analysis showed that a sludge discharge flow of 250-300 m3/day (solid retention time (SRT), 13-15 days) was appropriate for the enhancement of phosphorus removal without excessive sludge production. The proposed optimal control strategy was: activating 5 rotating disks operated with a mode of 111100100 ( 1 represents activation and 0 represents inactivation) for aeration and sludge discharge flow of 200 m3/day (SRT, 19 days). Compared with the baseline, this strategy could achieve ammonium violation below 10% and TP violation below 30% with substantial reduction of aeration energy cost (46%) and minimal increment of sludge production (< 2%). This study provides a useful approach for the optimization of process operation and control. ",

The present work was conducted in the Jinghuiqu irrigation district to characterize the groundwater aquifer, which has undergone long-term flood irrigation for over 2000 years. Isotopic and hydrochemical analyses, along with geological and hydrogeological tools, were used to determine the chemical properties and evolutionary processes of the groundwater aquifer. Results showed that the groundwater chemistry had changed significantly from 1990 to 2009.Water with concentrations of CaMgSO4 had decreased significantly, from 60% to 28% of the total water samples, during the period, while water with concentrations of NaSO4 and NaCl increased significantly, from 28% to 72%. The salinity of the groundwater increased rapidly and the affected area had expanded to most of the irrigation district. Stable isotope studies showed that most of the groundwater concentrations were derived from sulfate mineral dissolution. The minerals saturation indices (SI), ion ratios and oxygen isotope values of the groundwater indicated that the shallow groundwater had mainly experienced mineral dissolution, cation exchange, and mixing of the irrigated surface waters and groundwater. The groundwater quality had continuously evolved toward salinization as concentrations of SO42- and Na+ grew to dominate it. Water quality risk analyses showed that most of the saline groundwater is not suitable for domestic and irrigation uses, especially in the middle and eastern parts of the irrigation district. These findings indicate that the irrigation district should strengthen the groundwater resources management.",

Subsidies introduced by governments for the production of renewable energies have increased the investments in this sector. Since ground-based solar cells need land for energy production, then potential trade-off with agriculture in terms of land exists. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The paper uses the real option approach in order to take into account for uncertainty and irreversibility of the farmer\u2019s decision. Findings \u2013 By applying the model to the province of Bologna (Italy), the paper illustrates the possible land-use change scenarios in this area. The paper concludes by discussing the importance of PV energy production as a source of income for farmers and its implications from a social perspective. Originality/value \u2013 The research is applied to the province of Bologna (Italy) where investments in ground-based solar cells are becoming quite common. The originality lies in the fact of considering the investment as irreversible, since it is a 20-year commitment from the farmers. The paper also takes into account the uncertainty in agricultural commodities\u2019 prices.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The world today is continuously striving toward a carbon neutral clean energy technology. Hence, renewable wind power systems are increasingly receiving the attention of mankind. Energy production with structurally more promising and economically more competitive design is no more the sole criterion while installing new megawatt (MW) range of turbines. Rather important life cycle analysis (LCA) issues like climate change, ozone layer depletion, effect on surrounding environments e.g. eco-system quality, natural resources and human health emerge as dominant factors from green energy point of view. Hence, the study covers life cycle impact analysis (LCIA) of three wind farms: one onshore horizontal, one offshore horizontal, another vertical axis. It appears that vertical axis wind farm generates per unit electricity with lowest impact followed by horizontal offshore and horizontal onshore farms. The study, henceforward, discovers most adverse impact contributing materials in today's multi megawatt wind turbines and subsequently substitutes copper, the topmost impact contributor, with more eco-friendly aluminum alloys and its corresponding process routes. In this process, it reduces overall life cycle impacts up to 30% for future greener wind farms. In later stages, it compares all major electricity production technologies, viz., oil, diesel, coal, natural gas, wind, solar, biomass, nuclear, hydro plant in a common platform which demonstrates the wind farms performing the best except the hydro-kinetic ones. However, as the study suggests, offshore VAWT farm may even perform better than hydro-kinetic farms because of higher capacity factors in the high sea. Findings from the study can be deployed to harness massive scale green electricity from environmentally more clean and green turbines. .",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Having different mindsets, academics and industrialists are living in different worlds and pursuing different goals. The Academic is striving for creating new solutions with a high innovation rate, scientific achievements and recognition from peers with a long range perception. The Industrialist thinks in terms of short range goals, prefers proven solutions with a low risk and is mainly concerned with costs, profits and economic survival. In view of that, the deficiency of properly skilled labor across the oil and gas industry is emerging as a significant and complex challenge to Middle Eastern countries' future development. Regardless of the large number of universities, technical graduates and post-graduates added to the workforce, only small percentage of them are considered employable by the rapidly growing industry. Hence, the growing gap between academia and industry is reflected on slight availability of high-quality college/university graduates demanded by the industry. This problem can be overcome by having proper and sustainable industry-academia interactions that help to pass on relevant knowledge. Academic institutions place a great importance to closer interaction with industry and research and development organizations. Some interaction has been witnessed, in the developed countries, between large public and private sector enterprises and academic institutes at a level of industry involvement in technology development. Still, industry support to basic research is almost non-existent in developing countries. Academic institutions laboratories utilization by industry for developmental purposes and for product testing has seen some success. With the establishment of in-house research centers by different industries such labs utilization is on a gradual decrease. Effective collaboration between the oil and gas industry and universities will be critical to the industry economic recovery and sustainable international competitiveness. Industry must also make a sustained effort in supporting higher education by providing the support needed to help students build the employability and technical skills that are so important. The joint research venture can be successful only by proper project preparation and implementation. Some cases of cooperation between academia and Senergy GB Limited will be discussed. A number of key issues to achieve successful cooperation between industry and academia are suggested. The areas in which interaction is possible include industry support to basic research for knowledge creation, industry participation in technology development involving some exploratory work, academic intervention in solving industry problems, laboratory utilization by industry, faculty members' sabbatical leave and industry involvement in curriculum development. Also, the paper proposes that the oil and gas industry should work with universities to: Sponsor students studying subjects relevant to industrial needs. Offer more opportunities for internships, placements, work experience or projects. View working with universities as part of core innovation activity.

The analysis shows that the energy consumed in residential sector has the major share in the total energy consumed in urban Afghanistan. About 72% of the total residential energy is spent for cooking purposes, and firewood is still the predominant form of energy with a share of around 58% for different end uses. Details on current energy process and the energy expenditure for different income levels have been presented. Although the total energy consumption in urban household is relatively lower in Afghanistan, the paper argues that the increase in consumption and transition to modern fuels is likely with increased urbanization, socioeconomic development and improved electricity supply. Against the backdrop of likely increase in energy use, the issue of sustainability becomes significant and therefore, policies are key to ensuring energy development taking into consideration sustainability concerns. .",

It addresses the negative influences, which the existing majority-minority divide, quota system, and the issue of corruption have on capacity building in the public sector and examines the moderating role played by public service training arrangements in capacity building. Mixed method is used and data are taken from survey and interviews with public officials. Findings show that efforts to accommodate the minority in the public services, quota system, and corruption harm the capacity-building initiative of the Indian central government. However, training can assist capacity building by serving as a moderator for accommodating diverse groups between competing needs in the pluralistic Indian society. Hence, improvement of training quality and effectiveness are expected to ensure that public servants are aware of the rules and that their applications possess the ability to tender relevant advice and assistance to the political executive. Furthermore, the findings may be used to draw insights about bureaucracy in other developing countries, although this study is based on efforts to build capacity in India. ",

    "title": "Sustainable consumption",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Increasing consumption of consumer products and services with significant environmental and social impacts is a key contributor to many of today's sustainability challenges e.g., climate change, resource depletion (energy, water, biomass, metals, land use, and biodiversity loss), waste, pollution and social inequities. Consumer products are among those with the most significant environmental and social footprint. In particular, production and consumption of high-impact products and services, e.g., food, our homes, how we heat/cool them, the electronics we use, transport, clothing and tourism are recognized contributing factors to our most critical environmental and social challenges. Sustainable consumption and production (SCP) provides one set of solutions to tackling this. Supply side sustainable production measures to improve the sustainability performance of products across supply chains can only bring us so far. The role of the consumer in shifting consumption patterns so we can live ethically within our one planet means as well as the wider infrastructure to support this is also a key part of the solution. For this reason, influencing a shift to sustainable lifestyles is a growing focus for policy makers and other stakeholders with strong influence on consumer choice, e.g., retailers, brand manufacturers, educators and the media. Outside of this, the debate is growing on the inherent conflict between a traditional market economics system that continues to drive growth as resource limits become more obvious. This is forcing a more sophisticated approach to the new business and consumer models we are likely to need beyond SCP to meet our sustainability challenges as our population expands to an anticipated nine billion by 2050. In order to enable SCP demand and supply side measures to work, a paradigm shift in our economic system is needed. Key changes include internalizing environmental externality costs of production and consumption to send accurate market signals, remove perverse fiscal incentives, and actually motivate sustainable behavior change financially. In addition, our measures and indicators of success at country and business levels need to go beyond economic indicators, e.g., gross domestic product (GDP) alone, to incorporate not only financial but natural and social capital, as well as ensuring the required prioritization of these in practice. A reevaluation of human needs and wants is part of this paradigm shift with new definitions for how consumers and producers measure value reflected in new business and consumer models.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Metabolic processes have the potential to modulate the effects of ocean acidification (OA) in nearshore macroalgal beds. We investigated whether natural mixed assemblages of the articulate coralline macroalga Arthrocardia corymbosa and understory crustose coralline algae (CCA) altered pH and O2 concentrations within and immediately above their canopies. In a unidirectional flume, we tested the effect of water velocity (0-0.1 ms-1), bulk seawater pH (ambient pH 8.05, and pH 7.65), and irradiance (photosynthetically saturating light and darkness) on pH and O2 concentration gradients, and the derived concentration boundary layer (CBL) thickness. At bulk seawater pH 7.65 and slow velocities (0 and 0.015 ms-1), pH at the CCA surface increased to 7.90-8.00 in the light. Although these manipulations were short term, this indicates a potential daytime buffering capacity that could alleviate the effects of OA. Photosynthetic activity also increased O2 concentrations at the surface of the CCA. However, this moderating capacity was flow dependent; the CBL thickness decreased from an average of 26.8 mm from the CCA surface at 0.015 ms-1 to 4.1 mm at 0.04 ms-1. The reverse trends occurred in the dark, with respiration causing pH and O2 concentrations to decrease at the CCA surface. At all flow velocities the CBL thicknesses (up to 68 mm) were much greater than those previously published, indicating that the presence of canopies can alter the CBL substantially. In situ, the height of macroalgal canopies can be an order of magnitude larger than those used here, indicating that the degree of buffering to OA will be context dependent. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The effects of temperature and ultraviolet radiation (UVR; 280-400 nm) on seasonal succession in phytoplankton assemblages of Patagonia (Argentina) were studied in the context of global change. Samples collected during pre-bloom, bloom onset, bloom, and spring were exposed to in situ and increased (+4\u00b0C) temperatures and solar radiation with and without UVR. Daily cycles of effective photochemical quantum yield exhibited a pattern of high values in the morning, decreasing towards noon, and increasing in the afternoon. The decrease in yields towards noon as the season progressed increased from 30% in the pre-bloom to 80% in the spring; in the latter there were significant differences between radiation treatments under both temperature conditions. The highest inhibition rates were during the bloom, whereas the highest recovery rates were during the spring. Inhibition rates were generally higher in treatments exposed to UVR in comparison to photosynthetically active radiation-only treatments and some stages of the succession exhibited an additional temperature effect. Increasing temperatures had little effect on pre-bloom communities but helped to counteract the magnitude of the yield decrease during the bloom onset. However, during the bloom and in the spring, temperature and UVR acted synergistically, increasing the overall photochemical inhibition. Feedback mechanisms of increased temperatures causing a shallower mixing depth will expose phytoplankton to higher radiation, which will have a negative effect on the bloom and on spring assemblages. Due to the differential effects of solar UVR and increased temperature on phytoplankton, future studies should consider the repercussions on higher trophic levels. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "In multi-species communities, direct interactions among species create the potential for substantial indirect effects. The indirect effect of one species on another emerges from the densities of the interacting species along the path linking those species and the effect of species' traits on the magnitude of the per capita direct effects exerted by each species along that path. The dramatic changes in the size structure of many species that have been subjected to size-selective harvesting raises the question of whether this exchange of phenotypes - smaller fish for larger fish - will have substantial consequences for the ecosystem through changing the net indirect effects of the harvested species. We examine this question through two avenues. First, we review how body size in fishes influences the per capita direct effects exerted by a species. Second, we highlight experimental research with the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata Peters, 1859, that separates the indirect effects of exchanging phenotypes from those of altering densities. Together, these lines of evidence indicate that exchanging phenotypes can alter the indirect effects generated by a species in ways that resonate through ecosystems. We advocate a combination of further experiments in model systems and thoughtful mathematical simulation to understand these effects in larger ecosystems. We suggest that these efforts can improve our ability to anticipate the consequences of exchanging phenotypes through size-selective harvesting, with an eye toward a better approach to managing the complex ecosystems in which fisheries are embedded.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Because of their reliance on the harvest of fish and game, Alaskan rural communities have experienced a variety of impacts from climate change, the effects of which are amplified at high latitudes. We collaborated with hunters from the coastal community of Wainwright, Alaska, to document their observations of environmental change (e.g., sea ice, wind, temperature) and the implications of those changes for opportunities to hunt bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) during spring and caribou (Rangifer tarandus) during summer. We integrated hunter observations on wind with statistical analysis of daily wind speed data collected in the nearby community of Barrow, Alaska, between 1971 and 2010 to characterize changes in the number of days with suitable hunting conditions. Hunters in Wainwright currently observe fewer days than in previous decades with wind conditions suitable for safely hunting bowhead whales and caribou. The statistical analysis of wind speed data supported these conclusions and suggested that the annual windows of opportunity for hunting each species have decreased by up to seven days since 1971. This study demonstrates the potential power of collaboration between local communities and researchers to characterize the societal impacts of climate change. Continued collaborative research with residents of rural northern Alaskan communities could produce knowledge and develop tools to help rural Alaskans adapt to novel social-ecological conditions. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Introduction: Novel ecosystems that contain new combinations of invasive alien plants (IAPs) present a challenge for managers. Yet, control strategies that focus on the removal of the invasive species and/or restoring historical disturbance regimes often do not provide the best outcome for long-term control of IAPs and the promotion of more desirable plant species. Methods: This study seeks to identify the primary drivers of grassland invasion to then inform management practices toward the restoration of native ecosystems. By revisiting both published and unpublished data from experiments and case studies within mainly an Australian context for native grassland management, we show how alternative states models can help to design control strategies to manage undesirable IAPs by manipulating grazing pressure. Results: Ungulate grazing is generally considered antithetical to invasive species management because in many countries where livestock production is a relatively new disturbance to grasslands (such as in Australia and New Zealand as well as Canada and the USA), selective grazing pressure may have facilitated opportunities for IAPs to establish. We find that grazing stock can be used to manipulate species composition in favour of the desirable components in pastures, but whether grazing is rested or strategically applied depends on the management goal, sizes of populations of the IAP and more desirable species, and climatic and edaphic conditions. Conclusions: Based on our findings, we integrated these relationships to develop a testable framework for managing IAPs with strategic grazing that considers both the current state of the plant community and the desired future state-i.e. the application of the principles behind reclamation, rehabilitation, restoration or all three-over time.

Female youth face even more formidable challenges as a result of sex stereotypes and other forms of gender discrimination in education. This combination of factors also predisposes them to significant risk for dropping out of school and reduces their chances to attaining postsecondary education. Using ecological theory and a risk and resilience framework, we examined gender differences in risk and protective factors for academic outcomes in a sample of 276 Ghanaian youth recruited from 4 colleges in the northern and southern regions of the country. t tests and regression analyses revealed significant gender differences in risk and protection in relation to the presence of a school mentor, parental educational values, and delinquency at p<.05 significance level. Presence of a school mentor and poor neighborhood safety were significant but inversely related to achievement while region of residence predicted female achievement (Beta =. 360, p <.01).

It expands upon the method advanced by the Construction Industry Institute (CII) in 2003, and incorporates additional decision criteria and project delivery systems in a multi-tier decision computational platform. The paper integrates the analytical hierarchy process to alleviate the inherent subjectivity associated with the assignments of relative weights to selection criteria used in the CII method. It also expands the range of project delivery options to include Public Private Partnership (PPP) and Integrated Project Delivery (IDP). The range of selection criteria was expanded by 60, beyond the 20 criteria of the CII method. Relative effectiveness values are proposed for the added project delivery systems making use of recent project cases in Canada and the USA. The method was implemented in a spreadsheet application. Multiple scenarios were considered for one of the cases presented in the CII study and a sensitivity analysis performed based on the developments made in this paper. The differences in outputs between the CII method and the proposed method are discussed. This is the first decision framework that incorporates both the presently used PPP and the recently introduced IDP, along with the widely used project delivery systems. The developed method allows users to filter out the factors and alternatives that do not apply to the case at hand, based on key inputs at the upper tier. The method is flexible and can easily be expanded upon and customized by the user.",

We investigated family planning practices and related factors among families with affected children. We selected a total of 569 parents from the parents of patients with \u03b2-TM who were registered at thalassemia referral clinics in southern Iran. Information was recorded regarding demographic variables, socioeconomic status and family planning practices. The correlations between family planning practice and related factors were evaluated. Approximately 96.0% of the parents (546) were practicing contraception at the time of the study. Only 12.8% of the families whose first child had \u03b2-TM decided to have no more children. The most frequent contraceptive method was tubal ligation (TL) (37.5%) followed by oral contraceptive pills (OCP) (31.5%). Higher education level of the mothers and higher economic status of the families were found to be related with the lower numbers of children with \u03b2-TM (p = 0.001). We found a high percentage of safe contraception being used by at-risk couples. It seems that educational programs have been effective in influencing family planning practices. Further attention should be devoted to increasing the knowledge of at-risk couples with a greater focus on parents of low socioeconomic status. Because of cultural factors in Iran, many of these at-risk couples opted to achieve the desired family size, so implementation of a well-organized prenatal diagnostic system seems necessary. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Objectives: This study assessed whether the quality of the available road traffic injury (RTI) data was sufficient for determining the burden of RTIs in the Western Cape Province and for implementing and monitoring road safety interventions.Methodology: Underreporting was assessed by comparing data reported by the South African Police Services (SAPS) in 2008 with data from 18 provincial mortuaries. Completeness of the driver death subset of all RTIs was assessed using the capture-recapture method.Results: The mortuary and police data sets comprised 1696 and 860 fatalities respectively for the year 2008. The corresponding provincial road traffic mortality rates were as follows: 32.2 deaths/100,000 population per year (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30.7-33.8) and 16.3 deaths/100,000 population per year (95% CI: 15.3-17.5). The police data set contained 820,960 crashes, involving 196,889 persons, indicating substantial duplication of crash events. There were varying proportions of missing data for demographic and other identifying variables, with age missing in nearly half of the cases in the police data set. The estimated total number of driver deaths/year was 588.6 (95% CI: 544.4-632.8), yielding estimated completeness of the mortuary and police data sets of 57.6 and 46.4 percent separately and 77.3 percent combined.Conclusion: This study found extensive data quality problems, including missing data, duplication, and significant underreporting of traffic injury deaths in the police data. Not all assumptions underlying the use of capture-recapture method were met in this study; hence, the estimates provided by this analysis should be interpreted with caution. There is a need to address the problems highlighted by this study in order to improve data utility for informing road safety policies.Supplemental materials are available for this article.

In response, we explore the ideological elements that make lending through Kiva, an emergent microfinance charity, meaningful to its creators and supporters. A combination of interpretive methods is used to outline Kiva's ideology of entrepreneurial philanthropy. This utopian ideology is found to legitimize 'marketized' philanthropic practices by invoking alternative conceptions of poverty, social progress and philanthropy (i.e. representations of philanthropic giving, philanthropic benefactors and beneficiaries and the relations between them).

    "title": "Seasonal phytoplankton dynamics in the coastal waters of the north-eastern Adriatic Sea",
    "abstract_cleaned": "This study describes the dynamics of phytoplankton in relation to environmental factors in coastal waters of the north-eastern Adriatic Sea. The distant Po River's influence is rarely noted on the eastern coastal part of the northern Adriatic, but it does trigger the crucial alternations in the community, e.g. mass development of diatoms in July 2009. A highly variable ecosystem, like the northern Adriatic, sustains high species diversity. Even though quite a few species were present for more than several months, we identified the seminal species of the seasonal succession. During spring Prorocentrum micans, Leptocylindrus minimus, Chaetoceros throndsenii, Ceratium furca and Ceratium fusus were most characteristic. These species thrive in low salinity and mixed waters. Typical summer diatom species were Chaetoceros vixvisibilis and Proboscia alata, while Rhabdosphaera clavigera and Syracosphaera pulchra were identified as distinctive summer coccolithophorids. All the summer species preferred warmer waters with low nitrate and low silica content. The autumn community was characterised by species such as Calciosolenia murrayi, Chaetoceros socialis, Asterionellopsis glacialis, and Lioloma pacificum. These species were related not only to high nutrient conditions, but also to low Po River influence. In winter a prevalence of large diatoms Thalassiosira rotula, Neocalyptrella robusta and Pseudosolenia calcar-avis was recorded. The winter assemblage was characterised by species of cold water preference able to grow in well mixed conditions. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Recent studies using research vessels and submersibles have revealed unique chemical properties of hydrothermal fluids from arc-back-arc settings in western basins of the Pacific Ocean. We review the most notable of these subduction-related, tectonically induced geochemical features, as expressed in fluids discharged directly from the seafloor and the hydrothermal plumes that result. In particular, phase separation, interaction with sediments, and material supply from the subducting slab impart characteristic chemical signatures to arc-back-arc fluids. Special emphases are placed on the richness of volatile components and the extreme acidity (pH < 2) so far observed for these fluids. This paper also reviews two advances in observational technology especially useful in the arc-back-arc environment: an in situ chemical analyzer for monitoring temporal variations in fluid chemistry, and a gas-tight fluid sampling system that ensures high-integrity recovery of volatile-rich fluids.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The Manyingee ore body is a roll-front U ore body located at depth in the Cretaceous sandstone sediments of a Proterozoic palaeo valley. It is located in a confined aquifer. The aquifer is recharged 4 km upstream by the Ashburton River. Groundwater samples were collected at and up to 4.7 km downstream of the ore body. The ground water 234U/238U activity ratios (AR) were elevated to 1.86 in the vicinity of the ore body and then declined to 1.06 over the 4.7 km transect. The elevated 234U/238U ARs are attributed to selective leaching of 234U sites by oxidising waters, with \u03b1 recoil as a necessary precursor to produce activated 234U sites. Direct ejection into another phase following \u03b1 recoil is considered to be a minor contributor to 234U - 238U disequilibrium in this environment. The profile is considered to be typical of the 234U/238U AR profile at and down gradient of the redox front of a U ore body. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Understanding the way in which the climatic oscillations of the Quaternary Period have shaped the distribution and genetic structure of extant tree species provides insight into the processes driving species diversification, distribution and survival. Deciphering the genetic consequences of past climatic change is also critical for the conservation and sustainable management of forest and tree genetic resources, a timely endeavour as the Earth heads into a period of fast climate change. We used a combination of genetic data and ecological niche models to investigate the historical patterns of biogeographic range expansion of a wild fruit tree, the European crabapple (Malus sylvestris), a wild contributor to the domesticated apple. Both climatic predictions for the last glacial maximum and analyses of microsatellite variation indicated that M. sylvestris experienced range contraction and fragmentation. Bayesian clustering analyses revealed a clear pattern of genetic structure, with one genetic cluster spanning a large area in Western Europe and two other genetic clusters with a more limited distribution range in Eastern Europe, one around the Carpathian Mountains and the other restricted to the Balkan Peninsula. Approximate Bayesian computation appeared to be a powerful technique for inferring the history of these clusters, supporting a scenario of simultaneous differentiation of three separate glacial refugia. Admixture between these three populations was found in their suture zones. A weak isolation by distance pattern was detected within each population, indicating a high extent of historical gene flow for the European crabapple. .",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The American mink Neovison vison is an elusive mustelid that is monitored mostly through the detection of its field signs, namely, footprints and scats. In Europe, the American mink has been often monitored using the standard otter survey strategy developed specifically for the Eurasian otter Lutra lutra, requiring to walk transects of 600 m spaced at least 5 km apart. We tested whether the standard otter survey strategy was appropriate for surveying mink. We studied a high-density population of mink along a 9-km stretch of river between December 2004 and April 2005. Monthly surveys were conducted and scats and footprints were recorded within 100-m sections along the river. The results showed a monthly variation in signs recovery, with the months of December, January and February being the best ones for surveying. Transects of 600 m detected mink between 74 and 90 % of the times in all months, excluding March when detection was as low as 56 %. Taken all together, the results suggest that the standard otter survey strategy was adequate to detect mink, at least in this case where species density was high. The study also highlighted monthly differences in signs detection, suggesting that temporal variations should be taken into account when designing the sampling strategy and the length of the sampling units (transects). In the months immediately following the mating season (and possibly in lower-density mink populations), it may be advisable to increase the length of transects to increase detection of mink. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Both basic oxygen furnace (BOF) slag and cold-rolling wastewater (CRW) exhibiting highly alkaline characteristics require stabilization and neutralization prior to utilization and/or final disposal. Using CO2 from flue gases as the stabilizing and neutralizing agents could also diminish CO2 emissions. In this investigation, ex situ hot stove gas containing 30 vol% CO2 in the steelmaking process was captured by accelerated carbonation of BOF slag coupled with CRW in a rotating packed bed (RPB). The developed RPB process exhibits superior results, with significant CO2 removal efficiency (\u03b7) of 96-99% in flue gas achieved within a short reaction time of 1 min at 25 C and 1 atm. Calcite (CaCO3) was identified as the main product according to XRD and SEM-XEDS observations. In addition, the elimination of lime and Ca(OH)2 in the BOF slag during carbonation is beneficial to its further use as construction material. Consequently, the developed RPB process could capture the CO2 from the flue gas, neutralize the CRW, and demonstrate the utilization potential for BOF slag. It was also concluded that carbonation of BOF slag coupled with CRW in an RPB is a viable method for CO2 capture due to its higher mass transfer rate and CO2 removal efficiency in a short reaction time.

This study evaluated the relationships among impulsivity, stimulant-dependence diagnosis, and treatment completion. Six sites evaluating 12-step facilitation for stimulant abusers obtained the BIS-11 and Stroop from 182 methamphetamine- and/or cocaine-dependent participants. Methamphetamine-dependent, relative to cocaine-dependent, participants evidenced significantly greater BIS-11 non-planning and total scores. There was a trend for poorer response inhibition, measured by the Stroop, in cocaine-dependent, relative to methamphetamine-dependent, participants. Accounting for other factors related to treatment completion, BIS-11 motor score, assessing the tendency to act without thinking, predicted treatment completion for both cocaine-dependent and methamphetamine-dependent patients. These results suggest that methamphetamine-dependent and cocaine-dependent patients may have different impulsivity profiles but that the BIS-11 may be useful in identifying both methamphetamine-dependent and cocaine-dependent patients who are at risk for treatment non-completion.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Over the past quarter century the sex ratio at birth (SRB) has risen above natural levels in a number of countries, mostly in Asia. This rise has been made possible in populations with strong son preference by the increasing availability of safe, effective, and inexpensive technologies to determine the sex of a fetus and to end unwanted pregnancies. This article documents levels and trends in the sex ratio at birth, in preferences for male offspring (using information on desired number of girls and boys), and in the implementation of these preferences. DHS surveys from 61 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and for Indian states are the main source of data. A comparison of desired with actual SRBs finds large gaps in most populations, implying a substantial pent-up demand for male offspring and the technology to implement this preference. Two types of actions to implement preferences are considered: the practice of contraception to stop childbearing after the desired number of sons has been born and the use of sex-selective abortion to avoid female births. The second part of the article discusses factors that could influence the SRB, including the promotion of gender equality, and the implications of these factors for future trends. ",

Moldboard plow, chisel plow, spring disk, ridge-tillage, and no-tillage systems were evaluated after 32 years of a corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation and 27 years of continuous corn in central Iowa, U.S.A. Productivity was quantified using yield, while soil fertility status was evaluated by collecting four, 5-cm diameter soil cores to a depth of 0.9m from each treatment, dividing them into four depth increments (0-15-, 15-30-, 30-60-, and 60-90-cm), analyzing them for bulk density (BD), NO3-N, NH4-N, electrical conductivity (EC), pH, Mehlich-3 extractable P, K, Ca, Mg and DTPA-extractable Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn, and interpreting the data using Iowa State University (ISU) guidelines. Production costs for each tillage and cropping system were also computed. To account for genetic and agronomic changes during the 30-year study period, yields were examined for establishment, maintenance, and intensification/recovery phases. Rotated corn yield averaged 8.6, 8.8, and 11.6Mgha-1 and soybean yield averaged 2.7, 3.2, and 3.4Mgha-1, respectively, for each of the phases. Continuous corn from 1988 to 2006 averaged 7.5 and 10.1Mgha-1 for the maintenance and intensification/recovery phases, respectively. Fixed plus variable machinery costs for corn ranged from 233 to 354 USD ha-1, while for soybean they ranged from 194 to 280 USD ha-1. Net returns to land, labor and management ranged from 233 to 269, 560 to 620, and 437 to 483 USD ha-1 for continuous corn, rotated corn, and rotated soybean, respectively. Based on 9-year (2003-2011) average grain prices and yields from this study, the corn-soybean rotation was twice as profitable as continuous corn. Soil-test P and K measurements, as well as calculated P and K removal, suggest that nutrient mining occurred during the course of this study. The soil-test data also indicate that further studies are needed regarding plant availability of subsoil K and its impact on fertilizer recommendations. Overall, we conclude that with good nutrient management and crop rotation, yield and soil fertility differences between no-tillage and more intensive tillage systems can be minimized and that no-till production can be profitable on glacial till derived soils.

    "abstract_cleaned": "IPCC-type climate models have produced simulations of the oceanic environment that can be used to drive models of upper trophic levels to explore the impact of climate change on marine resources. We use the Spatial Ecosystem And Population Dynamics Model (SEAPODYM) to investigate the potential impact of Climate change under IPCC A2 scenario on Pacific skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis). IPCC-type models are still coarse in resolution and can produce significant anomalies, e.g., in water temperature. These limitations have direct and strong effects when modeling the dynamics of marine species. Therefore, parameter estimation experiments based on assimilation of historical fishing data are necessary to calibrate the model to these conditions before exploring the future scenarios. A new simulation based on corrected temperature fields of the A2 simulation from one climate model (IPSL-CM4) is presented. The corrected fields led to a new parameterization close to the one achieved with more realistic environment from an ocean reanalysis and satellite-derived primary production. Projected changes in skipjack population under simple fishing effort scenarios are presented. The skipjack catch and biomass is predicted to slightly increase in the Western Central Pacific Ocean until 2050 then the biomass stabilizes and starts to decrease after 2060 while the catch reaches a plateau. Both feeding and spawning habitat become progressively more favourable in the eastern Pacific Ocean and also extend to higher latitudes, while the western equatorial warm pool is predicted to become less favorable for skipjack spawning.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Natural ecosystems benefit human communities by providing ecosystem services such as water purification and crop pollination. Mapping ecosystem service values has become popular, but most are static snapshots of average value. Estimating instead the economic impacts of specific ecosystem changes can better inform typical resource decisions. Here we develop an approach to mapping marginal values, those resulting from the next unit of ecosystem change, across landscapes. We demonstrate the approach with a recent model of crop pollination services in Costa Rica, simulating deforestation events to predict resulting marginal changes in pollination services to coffee farms. We find that marginal losses from deforestation vary from zero to US$700/ha across the landscape. Financial risks for farmers from these losses and marginal benefits of forest restoration show similar spatial variation. Marginal values are concentrated in relatively few forest parcels not identified using average value. These parcels lack substitutes: nearby forest parcels that can supply services in the event of loss. Indeed, the marginal value of forest parcels declines exponentially with the density of surrounding forest cover. The approach we develop is applicable to any ecosystem service. Combined with information on costs, it can help target conservation or restoration efforts to optimize benefits to people and biodiversity. ",

Productivity of dryland crops can be increased only if the problems are understood well and in turn combated effectively. Major dryland agro ecological regions of the world and their problems are outlined in this chapter. Sustainable Natural Resource Management (SNRM) is stressed here as an important way to addresses the problems faced by these regions of the world. Resilience to predicted climate change will depend on increasing agricultural productivity with available water resources; refining technologies and timely deployment of affordable strategies to accomplish potential levels of arable land and water productivity. An account into the adaptation strategies to increase resilience to combat climate change related effects by management of water, soil and biodiversity are detailed here. We propose here that research on adaptive capability of crops by increasing their resilience to abiotic stresses, pests and diseases will have to expand to new horizons with a systems biology perspective.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Summary: The importance of genetic factors in substance addiction has long been established. The rationale for this work is that understanding of the function of addiction genes and delineation of the key molecular pathways of these genes would enhance the development of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers that could be used in the prevention and management of substance abuse. Over the past few years, there has been a substantial increase in the number of genetic studies conducted on addiction in China; these studies have primarily focused on heroin, alcohol, and nicotine dependence. Most studies of candidate genes have concentrated on the dopamine, opioid, and serotonin systems. A number of genes associated with substance abuse in Caucasians are also risk factors in Chinese, but several novel genes and genetic risk factors associated with substance abuse in Chinese subjects have also been identified. This paper reviews the genetic studies of substance abuse performed by Chinese researchers. Genotypes and alleles related to addictive behavior in Chinese individuals are discussed and the contributions of Chinese researchers to the international corpus of knowledge about the genetic understanding of substance abuse are described.",

    "title": "Distribution of loss cost using proportional nucleolus method in competitive power markets",
    "abstract_cleaned": "The present deregulated electricity industry has evolved into a distributed and competitive industry in which market forces drive the price of electricity and reduce the net cost of electricity. However the competitions in these markets require identification of the use of transmission networks, mainly the participation of utilities in losses caused in the transmission lines. This is because the consumers pay for their actual consumption where as generators are paid for their generation plus losses. Hence the loss cost allocation is of great importance as it should be allocated efficiently to both consumers and producers (both network users). Thus loss cost allocation in competitive electricity market requires a fair and efficient method with right economic signals. In this paper, loss cost allocation methodologies are presented in multilateral transaction frame work. Methodologies in cooperative game theory such as nucleolus, shapely and proportional nucleolus are presented. These are compared with conventional methods for loss allocation. Among all the methods presented, the proportional nucleolus is proved to be the efficient method with right economic signals. All the methods are implemented and results are compared for IEEE 14 bus, New England 39 bus and 75 bus Indian Power System. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Gulf licaria, Licaria trianda (Sw.) Kosterm., is a federally endangered member of the Lauraceae plant family in Miami-Dade County, Florida. It was never common in the area, and urban development has extirpated it from most of its former range; as of 2001, fewer than 10 trees remained in a single, remnant habitat in the continental United States, Simpson Park (25\u00b045\u203231\u2033N, 80\u00b011\u203246\u2033W) (2). Laurel wilt, caused by the fungus Raffaelea lauricola T. C. Harr., Fraedrich & Aghayeva, has recently devastated members of the Lauraceae in the southeastern United States, most notably redbay, Persea borbonia (1). As R. lauricola and its vector, the redbay ambrosia beetle Xyleborus glabratus, have spread in the region, an increasing number of taxa in this plant family have been affected by this disease (1). In 2012, seedlings of gulf licaria and redbay were obtained from local nurseries; they were grown in 30 liter pots, 1.3 m tall, had stems 3 cm in diameter 20 cm above the soil line, and were maintained with standard watering and fertilization practices. In two pathogenicity experiments on July 6 and September 25, 2012, three plants each of gulf licaria and redbay were inoculated with an isolate of R. lauricola, RL4, as described in previous experiments (3), and two plants each were mock inoculated (water control). RL4 is deposited as CBS 127349 at the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS Fungal Biodiversity Centre, Utrecht, The Netherlands), and a SSU rDNA sequence for it is deposited in GenBank under Accession No. HM446155. Beginning 2 weeks after inoculation, plants were rated on a weekly basis for the development of external symptoms, on a subjective 1 (no symptoms) to 10 (dead) scale (3). After 5 weeks, inoculated plants of redbay in each experiment (positive control) had died after first developing symptoms of wilt and necrotic foliage that are typical for this disease (1). In contrast, inoculated plants of gulf licaria developed severe symptoms by the time experiments were terminated 6 and 11 weeks after inoculation; chlorosis developed on some of the leaves of all plants and these eventually abscised (mean external severities of 7.3 and 6.5, respectively), but plants did not die. Brown to greyish discoloration of sapwood developed in all inoculated plants, and the pathogen was recovered from symptomatic sapwood on CSMA (3). No symptoms developed on mock inoculated plants and the pathogen was not recovered from them. It is concluded that gulf licaria is susceptible to laurel wilt, but that it is apparently less susceptible than redbay. Whether X. glabratus is attracted to, or will bore into, gulf licaria is not known, but will play a significant role in the extent to which this rare tree is affected by laurel wilt. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Water samples were collected at 20 sites on 4 occasions in 2009 (twice in May, and once in both August and November) along the Jiulong River, South China to examine how nutrient inputs from the Jiulong River could affect the nutrient status of the Xiamen Water. Samples were analyzed for nitrite (NO2-N), nitrate (NO3-N), ammonium (NH4-N), phosphate (PO4-P), silicate (SiO3-Si), salinity, and temperature, to determine the nutrient and trophic status of the river. The results indicate that nutrients are derived mainly from river runoff. NO3-N was the main form of DIN in most parts of the river. In addition, NO3-N, DIN, and SiO3-Si behave conservatively. There is a surplus of DIN and SiO3-Si in the river, and PO4-P is a limitation on phytoplankton growth. The concentration of DIN is typically above 0.60 mg/dm3, and higher than 1.00 mg/dm3 in most parts of the river. The concentration of PO4-P is typically above 0.02 mg/dm3, while the concentration of SiO3-Si is higher than 1.00 mg/dm3. Between 2003 and 2008, samples were collected 3 times per year (May, August and November) at 27 sites in the Xiamen Water and analyzed for NO2-N, NO3-N, NH4-N, PO4-P, salinity, and temperature. We discovered that the Jiulong River was the key source of DIN into the Xiamen Water, but not PO4-P, indicating the reason of the N/P molar ratio imbalance in the Xiamen Water. In the future, the effects of high DIN concentrations on the phytoplankton communities and marine ecosystems of the Xiamen Water shall be studied. ",

In this study, based on a long term fertilization experiment initiated in 1984, we researched the effect of different fertilizer application on soil water profile distribution and water use efficiency (WUE) from 1999 to 2010. The experimental design consisted a control treatment (CK) and eight fertilizer treatments: farmyard manure (M), farmyard manure and nitrogen (MN), farmyard manure and phosphorus (MP), nitrogen and phosphorus (NP), nitrogen, phosphorus and farmyard manure (NPM), nitrogen and potassium (NK), phosphorus and potassium (PK), nitrogen, potassium and potassium (NPK). Soil moisture content of MN, MP, MNP, M, and NP were significantly lower than Ck in 10-130 cm, while NPK and NK was only slightly lower than Ck. Compared with the CK, on average, treatments MNP and NPK increased the yield of crop by 259% and 226% and they also increased the crop WUE by 202% and 176%, respectively. The results indicated that the fertilizer application of NPK might be the best choice for the sustainable development of arid land agriculture on the Loess Plateau of China. ",

    "title": "Climate change and the oceans - What does the future hold?",
    "abstract_cleaned": "The ocean has been shielding the earth from the worst effects of rapid climate change by absorbing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This absorption of CO2 is driving the ocean along the pH gradient towards more acidic conditions. At the same time ocean warming is having pronounced impacts on the composition, structure and functions of marine ecosystems. Warming, freshening (in some areas) and associated stratification are driving a trend in ocean deoxygenation, which is being enhanced in parts of the coastal zone by upwelling of hypoxic deep water. The combined impact of warming, acidification and deoxygenation are already having a dramatic effect on the flora and fauna of the oceans with significant changes in distribution of populations, and decline of sensitive species. In many cases, the impacts of warming, acidification and deoxygenation are increased by the effects of other human impacts, such as pollution, eutrophication and overfishing.The interactive effects of this deadly trio mirrors similar events in the Earth's past, which were often coupled with extinctions of major species' groups. Here we review the observed impacts and, using past episodes in the Earth's history, set out what the future may hold if carbon emissions and climate change are not significantly reduced with more or less immediate effect.

    "title": "Uzbekistan: Rehabilitation of desert rangelands affected by salinity, to improve food security, combat desertification and maintain the natural resource base",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Synopsis: The chapter describes briefly the two key land degradation problems faced by Uzbekistan (i) widespread loss of rangeland productivity and stability, including loss of biodiversity and invasion by unpalatable and/or invasive species and (ii) problems associated with rising saline water tables and land abandonment. Results of research on vegetation distribution along salinity gradients, and evaluation of some indicators of salt tolerance are reported. The outcome of the screening of many plant species, herbs, shrubs and trees and the development of agro-silvi pastoral systems as a means of rehabilitating degraded land and improving livelihoods is outlined. The development and adoption of Biosaline Agriculture practices as a way to restore productivity of salt affected desert lands is explained. Key Points Rangeland vegetation of the arid and semi arid zones of Uzbekistan served as a crucial natural resource for livelihood development of the pastoral communities for many centuries and at the same time acts now as an ecological tool of protection against desertification. It is thus of great importance to preserve natural rangelands and to maintain their long term stability through application of consistent grazing management or using of improvement methods through cultivation of native drought and salt tolerant species. Facing the challenges of food security, Central Asian countries are keen to improve utilization of rangelands. Unfortunately, most governments in the region have limited financial resources, inconsistent legal instruments, and weak capacity to regulate and monitor sustainable use of rangelands. Thus, a more holistic approach to the ecosystem processes is needed in order to reduce the feed gap and mitigate rangeland degradation and desertification. Spatial and temporal changes of natural rangelands vegetation in the arid area affected by salinity need to be understood in order to initiate different revegetation strategies. Halophytes are an underutilized plant resource. They grow well in association with a variety of arid/semi-arid rangeland species and often provide severe competition to perennial species, both in natural and improved pastures. Where rangeland degradation has occurred there is need for rehabilitation measures to be applied. Incorporating fodder halophytes into the agro-silvi pastoral system or domestication of wild halophytes species represents low cost strategies for rehabilitation of desert degraded rangelands and abandoned farmer lands affected both by soil and water salinity. Introduction and adaptation of native drought tolerant fodder desert species and halophytes have the potential to provide a way to improve the livelihood of farmer's income at abandoned degraded marginal areas. A mixture of desert fodder species planted within the inter-spaces of salt-tolerant trees/shrubs plantations improves productivity of degraded rangelands affected by soil salinization. Application of such an approach solves the animal feed gaps in the lands degraded both by overgrazing and salinity, and leads to increased income for farmers. Agro-silvi-pastoral approaches for landscape planning and rehabilitation of saline soils represent a model of ecosystem function/services for agro-pastoral communities as adaptation measures to mitigate climate change impacts Dryland salinity and associated water quality are recognized to be among the most severe natural resource degradation problems in the marginal desert belt of Aral Sea Basin. Access to irrigation water in this region has drastically decreased in the last years, which caused additional obstacles to rangelands productivity and agricultural production. Replacement of deep-rooted, perennial native vegetation with shallow-rooted, annual agricultural crops and halophytic pastures has resulted in increased recharge causing shallow saline water tables leading to dryland salinity and loss of plant diversity. This results in greater amounts of water entering a groundwater system, water table rise and the concentration of naturally occurring salts near the soil surface. The Integrated Biosaline Agriculture Program for sustainable use of marginal mineralized water and salt affected soils for food-feed crops and forage legumes assists in improving food security, alleviating poverty and enhancing ecosystem health in smallholder crop-livestock systems. Diversification of agro-ecosystems and development of new agricultural capacities could increase income source of rural poor and farmers which so far are often dependent on two major crops (e.g. cotton and wheat).",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Seawater intrusion is a major threat to the rapidly depleting groundwater resources in the coastal areas of India. Groundwater-based irrigation, significant industrial development and rapid urbanization are some of the key contributors exacerbating the stress on groundwater resources. Vulnerability to seawater intrusion in the Ramanathapuram district of Eastern India is assessed here utilizing the GALDIT method, for a period of 10 years (2001-2010). Results revealed a drastic increase in percent area coverage under moderate vulnerability, from 19.5 to 53.88 %, between the years 2001 and 2010. On the contrary, areas classified as highly vulnerable underwent minor changes over the span of the study. Vulnerability of the study area was also analyzed for the year 2050 considering an average global mean sea level rise of 3.1 mm/year. Results from the analysis for the year 2050 showed that, almost, the entire study area (~97 %) was classified under moderate vulnerability. As a remedial measure to this imminent threat, favorable zones for artificial recharge were delineated on the basis of overlay analysis with weightage values for important controlling factors. Subsequently, the quantity of artificial recharge required to inhibit the intrusion of seawater, at specified favorable zones were estimated to be 674.87, 599.18 and 1,450.66 m3/year. ",

    "title": "REVIEW: Charcoal function and management in boreal ecosystems",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Summary: Charcoal plays an important role in soil function and carbon storage in fire-prone ecosystems. Charcoal is present in most boreal forest soils as a result of naturally recurring wildfires, which convert 0\u00b77-2% of biomass to charcoal. In boreal forests, charcoal represents 8-10% of soil carbon and 1 pg of carbon globally. Charcoal is resistant to decay, representing a form of super-passive carbon, with half-lives one to two orders of magnitude greater than those of other soil organic matter. High concentrations of negative surface charges increase nutrient retention, impacting boreal soil function, productivity and species composition. Due to a lack of soil mixing processes, charcoal in boreal soils is vulnerable to recombustion in recurring fires, inhibiting the accumulation of charcoal over time, unlike in other fire-prone ecosystems. Boreal charcoal stocks are highly variable. Increased fire intensity results in greater charcoal formation, with stand-replacing crown fires resulting in much larger charcoal stocks than non-stand-replacing ground fires. Current estimates of carbon storage based on Scandinavian studies of non-stand-replacing fires may underestimate charcoal stocks by factors of 2-3. Synthesis and applications. Charcoal contributes to boreal soil function, ecosystem productivity, nutrient retention and carbon cycling. In the absence of fire, charcoal loses many active properties, contributing to declining productivity with increasing time since fire. Incorporation of charcoal into ecosystem management using prescribed burns may contribute to sustainable management of boreal forests and maintaining global carbon cycles.

    "abstract_cleaned": "The removal of three basic dyes by adsorption onto bentonite was investigated for single, binary, and ternary solutions in a batch system. Before and after dye adsorption, bentonite samples were analyzed by using X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, SEM, and Fourier transform IR spectrometry. The D-optimal design and response surface methodology were applied in designing the experiments for evaluating the interactive effects of each initial concentrations variable of the dyes in binary systems. Predicted values were found to be in good agreement with experimental values, which defined propriety of the model and the achievement of D-optimal in optimization of adsorption of binary dye systems. The competitive adsorption results showed that the adsorption amount of a dye was suppressed in the presence and increasing concentrations of second or third dye. For mono-component isotherm modeling, Langmuir and Freundlich models were applied to equilibrium data of single, binary, and ternary dye solutions, while modified Langmuir, Sheindrof-Rebhun-Sheintuch and modified extended Freundlich models were also applied to equilibrium data of binary dye solutions for multi-component isotherm modeling. The results showed that the Langmuir was the more suitable model for single dye systems while extended Freundlich model fitted best to the experimental data with the lowest error values for multi-dye systems. Adsorption of BB, BR, and BY basic dyes was investigated in single, binary, and ternary solutions. Predicted values were found to be in good agreement with experimental values, which defined propriety of the model and the achievement of D-optimal in optimization of adsorption of binary dye systems.

    "abstract_cleaned": "This chapter begins with a brief introduction from the literature on the main issues and players involved in political controversy over vaccine use. One major federal level political challenge regarding vaccine safety is discussed involving US Congressman Dan Burton. Recent state level legislation has centered on passage of laws addressing parental rights regarding vaccination decisions, based on various safety concerns, while generally seeking to continue a primary focus on protection of society from communicable diseases. Controversial state and institutional policies are discussed that include daycare, school, and health care personnel (HCP) immunization mandates intended to optimize immunization rates. Exemption legislation that has focused on eliminating or limiting the power of mandates has generated much debate as well. Parental rights and values controversies are discussed relative to concerns raised by social conservatives that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine promotes immoral behavior among youth. In conclusion, one new political and legal controversy is discussed that bodes to significantly impact public health in general, as well as access to immunizations, namely, the 2010 health care reform legislation provisions addressing public access to vaccines and insurance coverage of immunization services across the lifespan.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Based on detailed hydrological and hydrochemical surveys carried out in each of the four seasons of 2008, Amursky Bay in the north west quadrant of the Japan Sea was found to experience seasonal hypoxia. The primary process of hypoxia formation is a microbiological degradation of the excess amount of diatoms under rather low photosynthetic active radiation in bottom layer and weak water dynamics. The microbiological decay of dead diatoms under light deficient conditions intensively consumes dissolved oxygen and produces phosphates, ammonium, silicates, and dissolved inorganic carbon. Existence of a phytoplankton excess is caused by phytoplankton bloom resulting from nutrient pulses into Amursky Bay. There are two main sources of these nutrients: the waste waters of Vladivostok city and discharge from Razdolnaya River. The river delivers more than two times the amount of nutrients than the waste waters of Vladivostok. It is suggested that the phytoplankton excess might be caused by an enhanced supply of nutrients delivered into the surface layer resulting from the increased discharge of the river on a short time scale. Our data suggest that hypoxia is seasonal, with a peak at the end of summer. The upwelling of the Japan Sea water in the beginning of the fall season and its advection across the shelf is the primary process by which the hypoxia is destroyed. During the winter, strong vertical mixing due to termohaline convection makes the water column uniform and brings more oxygen into the water along with high primary production under the ice. Thus, during the winter season, the ecosystem of Amursky Bay recovers completely.",

As a result, more than 70 volcanic bodies are ascertained. They are divided into two types: (1) laminated lava and pyroclastic rocks in the Cenozoic sedimentary sequence; and (2) conoid, mounded or wedged basalt with rigid basement under the Cenozoic sedimentary sequence. In the early Cenozoic (E1-E2), the acidic, neutral and basic volcanic rocks developed, while in the mid-late Cenozoic (E3-Q), single basic rocks existed intensively. The volcanic lithofacies mainly include the lower and middle effusive subfacies and the pyroclastic flow deposit explosive subfacies. Spatially, from the Southeast Hainan Basin to the Pearl River Mouth Basin, the Cenozoic volcanic activity gradually enhances; from shallow water area to the Central Basin of the South China Sea, the scale of Cenozoic volcanic rocks increases gradually, and the age tends to be younger. These activities improve the formation temperature, reduce the hydrocarbon generation threshold, and promote the hydrocarbon accumulation. Volcanic rocks in Wenchang Formation (E2w) to Zhujiang Formation (N1z) provide favorable conditions for hydrocarbon accumulation, so they are important targets in the deep exploration. ",

We compared the performance of population viability analyses developed by numerous scientific teams to estimate extinction risk of anadromous Pacific salmonids listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and challenged each analysis with data from 34 populations. We found variation in estimated extinction risk among analytical techniques, which was driven by varying model assumptions and the inherent uncertainty of risk forecasts. This result indicates that the scientific teams developed techniques that perform differently. We recommend that managers minimize uncertainty in risk estimates by using multiple models tailored to the local ecology. Assessment of relative extinction risk was less sensitive to model assumptions than was assessment of absolute extinction risk. Thus, the former method is better for comparing population status and raises caution about conclusions regarding absolute extinction risk. Received October 18, 2012; accepted July 3, 2013. ",

    "title": "Gender inequalities in health: Exploring the contribution of living conditions in the intersection of social class",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Background: Women experience poorer health than men despite their longer life expectancy, due to a higher prevalence of non-fatal chronic illnesses. This paper aims to explore whether the unequal gender distribution of roles and resources can account for inequalities in general self-rated health (SRH) by gender, across social classes, in a Southern European population. Methods: Cross-sectional study of residents in Catalonia aged 25-64, using data from the 2006 population living conditions survey (n = 5,817). Poisson regression models were used to calculate the fair/poor SRH prevalence ratio (PR) by gender and to estimate the contribution of variables assessing several dimensions of living conditions as the reduction in the PR after their inclusion in the model. Analyses were stratified by social class (non-manual and manual). Results: SRH was poorer for women among both non-manual (PR 1.39, 95% CI 1.09-1.76) and manual social classes (PR 1.36, 95% CI 1.20-1.56). Adjustment for individual income alone eliminated the association between sex and SRH, especially among manual classes (PR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85-1.19; among nonmanual 1.19, 0.92-1.54). The association was also reduced when adjusting by employment conditions among manual classes, and household material and economic situation, time in household chores and residential environment among non-manual classes. Discussion: Gender inequalities in individual income appear to contribute largely to women's poorer health. Individual income may indicate the availability of economic resources, but also the history of access to the labour market and potentially the degree of independence and power within the household. Policies to facilitate women's labour market participation, to close the gender pay gap, or to raise non-contributory pensions may be helpful to improve women's health. ",

The realities of global poverty and the inequalities between the \u2018haves\u2019 and the \u2018have-nots\u2019 are clear and well documented, and the gaps between world\u2019s richest and the world\u2019s poorest are ever-increasing. But, even though funding development is assumed to be key, the relationship between finance and development is contested and complex. This book explores the variety of relationships between finance and development, offering a broad and critical understanding of these connections and perspectives. It breaks finance down into its various aspects, with separate chapters on aid, debt, equity, microfinance and remittances. Throughout the text, finance is presented as a double-edged sword: while it is a vital tool towards poverty reduction, helping to fund development, more critical approaches remind us of the ways in which finance can hinder development. It contains a range of case studies throughout to illustrate finance in practice, including, UK aid to India, debt in Zambia, Apple\u2019s investment in China, microfinance in Mexico, government bond issues in Chile, and financial crisis in East Asia. The text develops and explores a number of themes throughout, such as the relationship between public and private sources of finance and debates about direct funding versus the allocation of credit through commercial financial markets. The book also explores finance and development interactions at various levels, from the global structure of finance through to local and everyday practices. Global Finance and Development offers a critical understanding of the nature of finance and development. This book encourages the reader to see financial processes as embedded within the broader structure of social relationships. Finance is defined and demonstrated to be money and credit, but also, crucially, the social relationships and institutions that enable the creation and distribution of credit and the consequences thereof. This valuable text is essential reading for all those concerned with poverty, inequality and development.",

In order to protect the agricultural sector in Europe and to stabilize farmers' revenues and incomes, starting from the 1950s the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) established a subsidies regime. Typically, policy interventions may produce two undesirable outcomes: (1) distortion of farmers' preferences, averting agricultural sector from economic efficiency; (2) production concentration towards protected cultivations, so reducing biodiversity and hindering the sustainability of agricultural activity. Under this perspective, the sustainability of agricultural policies should be evaluated in terms of their effect on agricultural biodiversity, and a trade-off between subsidies and biodiversity in agriculture is expected. This chapter investigates the relationship between subsidies and biodiversity in six Italian Objective-1 regions, finding a negative and quite stable correlation between these variables. Recent CAP reforms aimed at reducing market distortions through the adoption of decoupled measures, that supported agricultural activity regardless of the type of crop produced are expected to bring positive effects on agricultural biodiversity and sustainability.",

And then, by using an analytic hierarchy process (AHP), each evaluation index weight is determined, and according to the factor of weight overlap, the risk index is determined. Finally the risk regionalization of Yantai coastal areas is made based on the GIS space analysis function. Results show that the high risk regions of seawater intrusion include Laizhou city, Longkou city, Zhifu district; medium risk regions include Haiyang city, Muping district, Penglai city, Laishan district; low risk regions include Zhaoyuan city, Fushan district, LaiYang city.

We investigate the relationship between business cycles and heart disease in Mexico using a unique state-level dataset of 512 observations consisting of real GDP and heart disease incidence rates (overall and by age group) from 1995 to 2010. Our study is one of the first to use a state-level panel approach to analyze the relationship between the business cycle and morbidity. Further, the state and year fixed effects employed in our econometric specification reduce possible omitted variable bias. We find a general procyclical, although largely statistically insignificant, contemporaneous relationship. However, an increase in GDP per capita sustained over five years is associated with considerable increases in the incidence rates of ischemic heart disease and hypertension. This procyclical relationship appears strongest in the states with the lowest levels of development and for the oldest age groups. Our results suggest that economic fluctuations may have important lagged effects on heart disease in developing countries. .",

As more research evidence is provided about adolescent learning, teachers are considered pivotal to adolescents' educational development. Reform measures need to be targeted at the inservice and preservice teacher levels. This quantitative study employs a 40-item, five part Likert scale survey to understand preservice teachers' (n = 142) perceptions of their confidence to teach in a middle school at the conclusion of their tertiary education. The survey instrument was developed from the literature, with connections to the Queensland College of Teachers' professional standards. Results indicated that they perceived themselves as capable of creating a positive classroom environment with seven items greater than 80%, except with behaviour management (< 80% for two items), and they considered their pedagogical knowledge to be adequate (i.e., 7 out of 8 items > 84%). Items associated with implementing a middle school curriculum had varied responses (e.g., implementing literacy and numeracy were 74%, while implementing learning with real world connections was 91%). This information may assist coursework designers. For example, if a significant percentages of preservice teachers indicate that they believe they were not well prepared for assessment and reporting at the middle school level, then course designers can target these areas more effectively.

    "title": "Exploring the Relationship between Access to Water, Sanitation and Hygiene and Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infection: A Demonstration of Two Recursive Partitioning Tools",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Background:Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) - a class of parasites that affect billions of people - can be mitigated using mass drug administration, though reinfection following treatment occurs within a few months. Improvements to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) likely provide sustained benefit, but few rigorous studies have evaluated the specific WASH components most influential in reducing infection. There is a need for alternative analytic approaches to help identify, characterize and further refine the WASH components that are most important to STH reinfection. Traditional epidemiological approaches are not well-suited for assessing the complex and highly correlated relationships commonly seen in WASH.Methodology:We introduce two recursive partitioning approaches: classification and regression trees (C&RT) and conditional inference trees (CIT), which can be used to identify complex interactions between WASH indicators and identify sub-populations that may be susceptible to STH reinfection. We illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches utilizing school- and household-level WASH indicators gathered as part of a school-based randomized control trial in Kenya that measured STH reinfection of pupils 10 months following deworming treatment.Principal Findings:C&RT and CIT analyses resulted in strikingly different decision trees. C&RT may be the preferred approach if interest lies in using WASH indicators to classify individuals or communities as STH infected or uninfected, whereas CIT is most appropriate for identifying WASH indicators that may be causally associated with STH infection. Both tools are well-suited for identifying complex interactions among WASH indicators.Conclusions/Significance:C&RT and CIT are two analytic approaches that may offer valuable insight regarding the identification, selection and refinement of WASH indicators and their interactions with regards to STH control programs; however, they represent solutions to two distinct research questions and careful consideration should be made before deciding which approach is most appropriate.

    "abstract_cleaned": "As a consequence of population growth and urbanization, arable fields are increasingly irrigated with wastewater, but the related environmental and health risks (e.g., pollution with antibiotics) are poorly understood. We performed batch sorption experiments with sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) and soils that had been irrigated with untreated wastewater for 0, 14, 35, and 100 yr. Sorption of CIP was always strong and largely irreversible irrespective of the duration of wastewater irrigation and the content and quality of soil organic matter (SOM) (Freundlich sorption coefficient, KF: 346-979 mg1-1/n L1/n kg-1; 1/n: 0.62-0.76) but decreased with increasing soil pH due to a decreasing fraction of the cationic species. Sorption of SMX and sorption hysteresis were stronger in the nonirrigated soil (KF: 4.14 mg1-1/n L1/n kg-1 \u00b1 0.02; 1/n: 0.69 \u00b1 0.02) than in the irrigated soils (KF: 0.65-1.38 mg1-1/n L1/n kg-1; 1/n: 0.68-0.75). Irrigation (e.g., competition with SMX accumulated in soil or with other organic compounds contained in wastewater) and SOM quality (i.e., increase of carboxylic moieties with increasing time of irrigation) had a stronger effect on SMX sorption and its hysteresis than soil organic carbon content. Whereas sorption of SMX can be reduced by long-term irrigation with wastewater, sorption of CIP is intense also after prolonged irrigation. ",

The simulated values of walnut sap flow by fitted equation were good agreement with measured values in 2008 on daily and monthly time scales.

    "abstract_cleaned": "In coastal ecosystems with long flushing times (weeks to months) relative to phytoplankton growth rates (hours to days), chlorophyll a (chl-a) integrates nutrient loading, making it a pivotal indicator with broad implications for ecosystem function and water-quality management. However, numerical chl-a criteria that capture the linkage between chl-a and ecosystem impairments associated with eutrophication (e.g., hypoxia, water clarity and loss of submerged aquatic vegetation, toxic algal blooms) have seldom been developed despite the vulnerability of these ecosystems to anthropogenic nutrient loading. Increases in fertilizer use, animal wastes, and population growth in the Chesapeake Bay watershed since World War II have led to increases in nutrient loading and chl-a. We describe the development of numerical chl-a criteria based on long-term research and monitoring of the bay. Baseline chl-a concentrations were derived using statistical models for historical data from the 1960s and 1970s, including terms to account for the effects of climate variability. This approach produced numerical chl-a criteria presented as geometric means and 90th percentile thresholds to be used as goals and compliance limits, respectively. We present scientific bases for these criteria that consider specific ecosystem impairments linked to increased chl-a, including low dissolved oxygen (DO), reduced water clarity, and toxic algal blooms. These multiple lines of evidence support numerical chl-a criteria consisting of seasonal mean chl-a across salinity zones ranging from 1.4 to 15 mg m-3 as restoration goals and corresponding thresholds ranging from 4.3 to 45 mg m-3 as compliance limits. Attainment of these goals and limits for chl-a is a precondition for attaining desired levels of DO, water clarity, and toxic phytoplankton prior to rapid human expansion in the watershed and associated increases of nutrient loading.

Europe is currently in the process of preparing a top-down methodology to support the planning of a future pan-European power system that includes prioritised electricity highways or corridors that have the capability to address European and national energy targets, climate change policies and market requirements for a range of time horizons between 2020 and 2050. The UK is also committed to sourcing 15% of all energy from renewable resources by 2020 in order to achieve an 80-95% reduction of green house gas emissions by 2050. In order to achieve these objectives, a pan-European power system is required to facilitate the future transport of renewable energy sources over long distances to the load centres via Electricity Highway Systems. In this case, it is essential to identify appropriate scenarios considering all relevant technical, financial and socio-political aspects. Simultaneously, transmission system owners and operators must be provided with appropriate regulatory frameworks in order to overcome future challenges; therefore, efficient use of existing transmission networks and future investment planning should be taken into consideration when aiming to build a future pan-European power system.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "In the cold rolling production process in iron and steel industry, the operation optimization problem (OOP) is to determine the optimal setting for the control variables so as to maximize the product quality or minimize the total operation cost. Traditional OOP generally assumes that the production process is stable, however, the practical production process is dynamic and the dimensions of input coils such as crown and thickness often change during production. To tackle the dynamic change of dimensions of a coil and obtain a satisfactory setting for control variables that can guarantee a good product quality, this paper investigate the robust operation optimization problem (ROOP) in cold rolling production process. A mathematical model is constructed for the ROOP so as to minimize the total power of rollers and an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed. Computational results based on practical production data show that the proposed ROOP model and the PSO algorithm are very effective and they can help to reduce the energy consumption and at the same time obtain a better power allocation on rollers.

    "title": "The gender wage gap among Spanish managers",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the existence of sticky floor and glass ceiling effects in the gender wage gap (GWG) among Spanish managers. In addition, the paper determines if the pay gap at every quantile is a result of the gender characteristic differences, or the differences in returns to those characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: The paper exploits a counterfactual decomposition analysis, using quantile regression, to decompose the GWG into one component that is based on differences in characteristics and one component that is based on differences in coefficients across the wage distribution. Findings: A significant GWG over all the wage distribution is found. Such a gap exhibits a clear U-shaped pattern, thus pointing out both significant sticky floor and glass ceiling effects. Furthermore, the paper shows that such pattern is mainly determined by the coefficient effect, whose relative incidence is almost continuously increasing along the wage distribution. Research limitations/implications: While it is difficult to give a definitive explanation for the significant U-shaped pattern in the GWG and for the bigger incidence of the glass ceiling, the authors suggest two possible explanations that are consistent with these findings. The paper leaves the identification of these explanations to future research. Practical implications: The pattern of rising coefficient effects at higher quantiles suggests that the glass ceiling is a more relevant question than the sticky floor. Indeed, at the highest wage quantiles, differences in characteristics make essentially no contribution to the overall wage gap. This suggests that upper-echelon female managers have the same characteristics as their male counterparts, which emphasizes the role of discrimination for these top-level jobs. Originality/value: Despite the general GWG has been largely investigated, the analysis of a wage differential among managerial workers has certainly drawn much less attention. In particular just a few papers have investigated the existence of sticky floors and glass ceiling among managers. In addition, as to Spain, there is no empirical survey investigating and decomposing the gender pay gap among managers. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The Public Report on Health (PRoH) was initiated in 2005 to understand public health issues for people from diverse backgrounds living in different region specific contexts. States were selected purposively to capture a diversity of situations from better-performing states and not-so-well performing states. Based on these considerations, six states - the better-performing states of Tamil Nadu (TN), Maharashtra (MH) and Himachal Pradesh (HP) and the not-so-well performing states of Madhya Pradesh (MP), Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Orissa (OR) - were selected. This is a report of a study using food diaries to assess food intakes in sample households from six states of India. Method: Food diaries were maintained and all the raw food items that went into making the food in the household was measured using a measuring cup that converted volumes into dry weights for each item. The proportion consumed by individual adults was recorded. A nutrient calculator that computed the total nutrient in the food items consumed, using the 'Nutritive Value of Indian Foods by Gopalan et al., was developed to analyze the data and this is now been made available as freeware (http://bit.ly/ncalculator). The total nutrients consumed by the adults, men and women was calculated. Results: Identifying details having been removed, the raw data is available, open access on the internet http://bit.ly/foodlogxls.The energy consumption in our study was 2379 kcal per capita per day. According to the Summary Report World Agriculture the per capita food consumption in 1997-99 was 2803 which is higher than that in the best state in India. The consumption for developing countries a decade ago was 2681 and in Sub-Saharan Africa it was 2195. Our data is compatible in 2005 with the South Asia consumption of 2403 Kcal per capita per day in 1997-99. For comparison, in industrialized countries it was 3380. In Tamil Nadu it was a mere 1817 kcal. Discussion: The nutrient consumption in this study suggests that food security in the villages studied is far from achieved. It is hoped that the new Food Security Ordinance will make a dent in the situation. The calculator for computing nutrients of foods consumed which we developed based on the ICMR defined nutrient values for Indian foods has been made available as freeware on the internet. This is with the hope that more such studies can be carried out at the household level.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "In the event of a disaster, the communication infrastructure can be partially or totally destroyed, or rendered unavailable due to high congestion. Today's smart-phones that can communicate directly via Bluetooth or WiFi without using any network infrastructure, can be used to create an opportunistic post disaster communication network where situational data can spread quickly, even in the harshest conditions. However, presence of malicious and unscrupulous entities that forward sensitive situational data in such a network may pose serious threats on accuracy and timeliness of the data. Therefore, providing basic security features, like authentication, confidentiality and integrity, to all communications occurring in this network becomes inevitable. But, in such an opportunistic network, that uses short range and sporadic wireless connections, no trusted third party can be used as it won't be accessible locally at the runtime. As a result, traditional security services like cryptographic signatures, certificates, authentication protocols and end-to-end encryption become inapplicable. Moreover, since disaster management is generally a group based activity; a forwarding entity may be better authenticated based on its group membership verification. In this paper, we propose a Group-based Distributed Authentication Mechanism that enables nodes to mutually authenticate each other as members of valid groups and also suggest a Multilayer Hashed Encryption Scheme in which rescue-groups collaboratively contribute towards preserving the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive situational information. The schemes provide authentication, confidentiality and integrity in a fully decentralized manner to suit the requirements of an opportunistic post disaster communication network. We emulate a post disaster scenario in the ONE simulator to show the effectiveness of our schemes in terms of delivery ratio, average delay and overhead ratio.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Given that funds for biodiversity conservation are limited, there is a need to understand people's preferences for its different components. To date, such preferences have largely been measured in monetary terms. However, how people value biodiversity may differ from economic theory, and there is little consensus over whether monetary metrics are always appropriate or the degree to which other methods offer alternative and complementary perspectives on value. We used a choice experiment to compare monetary amounts recreational visitors to urban green spaces were willing to pay for biodiversity enhancement (increases in species richness for birds, plants, and aquatic macroinvertebrates) with self-reported psychological gains in well-being derived from visiting the same sites. Willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates were significant and positive, and respondents reported high gains in well-being across 3 axes derived from environmental psychology theories (reflection, attachment, continuity with past). The 2 metrics were broadly congruent. Participants with above-median self-reported well-being scores were willing to pay significantly higher amounts for enhancing species richness than those with below-median scores, regardless of taxon. The socio-economic and demographic background of participants played little role in determining either their well-being or the probability of choosing a paying option within the choice experiment. Site-level environmental characteristics were only somewhat related to WTP, but showed strong associations with self-reported well-being. Both approaches are likely to reflect a combination of the environmental properties of a site and unobserved individual preference heterogeneity for the natural world. Our results suggest that either metric will deliver mutually consistent results in an assessment of environmental preferences, although which approach is preferable depends on why one wishes to measure values for the natural world.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model heterogeneous traffic behaviors by adapting a well-established personality trait model (i.e., Eysenck's PEN (psychoticism, extraversion and neuroticism) model) into widely used traffic simulation approaches. First, we collected a large amount of user feedback while users watch a variety of computer-generated traffic simulation video clips. Then, we trained regression models to bridge low-level traffic simulation parameters and high-level perceived traffic behaviors (i.e., adjectives according to the PEN model and the three PEN traits).We also conducted an additional user study to validate the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach, in particular, high correlation coefficients and the Pearson values between users' feedback and our model predictions prove the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our approach can also produce interesting emergent traffic patterns including faster-is-slower effect and sticking-in-a-pin-wherever-there-is-room effect. Copyright .",

The paper provides a climatological overview of LTP in BJR. LTP contributes 61.7% to the total amount of precipitation in BJR in the cold season (November-March). There is a slight increasing trend [1.22 mm (10 yr)-1] in the amount of total precipitation for the cold season during 1960-2008. In contrast, the amount of LTP decreases by 0.6 mm (10 yr)-1. The warming rate of Tmin in BJR is 0.66\u00b0C (10 yr)-1. Correspondingly, the frequency of LTP decreases with increasing Tmin by -0.67 times per \u00b0C. The seasonal frequency and amount of LTP in southeast BJR (mostly urban sites) are 17%-20% less than those in the northwestern (rural and montane sites). The intensity of LTP for the urban sites and northeastern BJR exhibited significant enhancing trends [0.18 and 0.15 mm d-1 (10 yr)-1, respectively]. The frequency of slight LTP (<0.2 mm d-1) significantly decreased throughout BJR [by about -15.74% (10 yr)-1 in the urban area and northeast BJR], while the contribution of the two heaviest LTP events to total LTP amount significantly increased by 3.2% (10 yr)-1.

    "abstract_cleaned": "The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), like many other stream-dependent species, is reportedly sensitive to catchment urbanization. However, the primary mechanism limiting its distribution in urban environments has not been identified. We created species distribution models for three platypus demographic classes: adult females (which are exclusively responsible for raising young), adult males (which are more mobile than females), and first-year juveniles. Using live-trapping data collected in Melbourne, Australia, we tested whether distributions of the three demographic classes were better predicted by catchment urban density (total imperviousness), by urban stormwater runoff (catchment attenuated imperviousness), or by stream size (catchment area). Two variants of each predictor variable were developed, one that accounted for platypus mobility, and one that did not. Female distribution was most plausibly predicted by stormwater runoff (accounting for mobility), with a steep decline in reporting rate from 0 to 10% attenuated imperviousness. Male distribution was equally plausibly predicted by stormwater runoff and urban density (both accounting for mobility), with a less steep and more uncertain decline with imperviousness than females. Juvenile distribution was most plausibly predicted by stream size (accounting for mobility), but both stormwater runoff and urban density (accounting for mobility) were nearly equally plausible predictors. The superior performance of models that accounted for mobility underscores the importance of accounting for this in species distribution models of highly mobile species. Platypus populations in urban areas are likely to be affected adversely by urban stormwater runoff conveyed by conventional drainage systems, with adult females more limited by runoff-related impacts than adult males or juveniles. Urban platypus conservation efforts have generally focused on restoring riparian and in-stream habitats on a local scale. This is unlikely to protect platypus from adverse impacts of urban stormwater runoff, which is most effectively managed at the catchment scale. ",

Herein, we predict the effects of future climate and land use change on cold-water fish habitat in the glacial lakes of the upper midwestern US. Ecoregion-specific, regional regression models were developed to predict annual phosphorus loading rates to lakes based on land use and hydrology and coupled to a previously developed fish habitat model. Outputs from one land use change model and three global climate models were then used to project future cold-water habitat. Significant decreases in cold-water habitat quality were projected in all four ecoregions of the study region, with increases in air temperature generally having greater impacts on habitat than land use changes. Projected localized increases in urbanization and corn acreage were found to degrade cold-water habitat for a subset of lakes in all ecoregions. For cisco (Coregonus artedi), the most thermally tolerant of the four species considered, it was found that most of the highest quality (tier 1) refuge lakes will shift to lower quality (tier 2) lakes with adequate habitat, and about half of the tier 2 lakes will shift to tier 3 (non-refuge) lakes with marginal habitat.",

Simultaneously suffer an emptying of properties and depending on the prior use, may exhibit contamination of soil and ground water. The article aims to evaluate the urban density, availability of sanitation infrastructure and socioeconomic status of the neighborhood to check the potential for urban redevelopment and reoccupation of contaminated areas in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo. Through GIS the Cetesb database for the year 2010 with the addresses of the contaminated areas was georeferenced and census tracts with information Censo/2010 as household density, access the sewage system, garbage collection, and income were dichotomized between those with and no contaminated areas. The differences between of median and quartiles of these variables were compared. The city had 1,190 registered as contaminated areas, distributed in 5.1% of its census tracts. Census tracts with contaminated areas have lower household density and greater access to the sewage system, solid waste collection and performance compared to sectors without contaminated area. The census tract with contaminated areas have higher sanitation infrastructure, however, have a lower density of households. Despite the effort to reoccupy these areas, there is still great potential for growth in these areas in the city.",

    "title": "Air quality assessment according to AQI and fuzzy SOFM in Xi'an, China",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Along with rapid economic growth and urbanization, air pollution is getting worse and worse. Great importance has been placed on the desire for air quality assessment and improvement in China. New national standard (GB3095-2012) has been proposed and on trial since 2013, which is stricter than the old one. Air Quality Index (AQI, HJ 633-2012), including ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter smaller than 10 (PM10) and 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5), has also been carried out at the same time. This paper addresses the methodologies for urban air quality using AQI and fuzzy neural networks. Xi'an, an inland city located in Northwestern of China, is selected for this purpose. There are 560 obtainable monitoring records of air pollutants used for our study provided by 13 monitoring sites in Xi'an since Jan 1, 2013. Firstly, AQI method is used to assess these records. The results show that 421 records are assessed as Poor and worse, 463 records for PM2.5 assessed as prominent pollutant. Compared with AQI method, SOFM is a more comprehensive method using fuzzy synthetic evaluation techniques. It is improved with a monotone decreasing exponential function as membership weighting index to be faster, and used to assess air quality in this paper. The results of our study demonstrate that fuzzy SOFM is quite appropriate techniques for air quality assessment. Unlike AQI method, SOFM's result is decided by all pollutant instead of only the most serious one. No matter what kind of method, all assessment results show the very serious air pollution in Xi'an. The government and every citizen must take steps at once to prevent air quality from further depravation. ",

Sustainable agricultural spatial model (SASM) was developed using Arc GIS 10 to identify and classify the area, according to sustainability degree of agricultural utilization, where the factors of productivity, security, protection, economic viability, and social acceptability in the different mapping units were assessed. The investigated area is classified into three different classes, I, II, are covered in about 7% of the total area where land management practices are marginally below the threshold for sustainability located in the northern part of the study area, where the sustainability values are ranging between 0.1 and 0.3. The areas characterized as class III do not meet sustainability requirements where the sustainable values <0.1. The current work shows how the decision-makers can increase the land sustainability classes I, II to 10% of the total area by controlling just two factors: social and economic factors.",

In doing so, we critique the approach current UK policy takes towards energy renewal and carbon reduction. We investigate the effectiveness of the social housing sector's efforts to implement environmental policy initiatives that use a technology-driven approach. By looking at how social housing residents consume energy as part of domestic practices, we identify tensions between strategies to influence energy consumption by a housing association, and the ways residents incorporate sustainable technologies into everyday practices. Our findings reveal how sustainable technologies become enrolled in established practices: residents creatively develop novel routine strategies to accommodate new technologies to their daily routines. We contend that policy efforts to engender 'behaviour change' through a technology-driven approach have limitations. This approach ignores how practices become entangled, affecting energy consumption. ",

The systems are widely used in many industries, including telecommunications and banking. Virtualization is a potential technology that can enable the easy development of IVR applications and their deployment on the cloud. IVR virtualization will enable efficient resource usage by allowing IVR applications to share different IVR substrate components such as the key detector, the voice recorder and the dialog manager. Resource management is part and parcel of IVR virtualization and poses a challenge in virtualized environments where both processing and network constraints must be considered. Considering several objectives to optimize the resource usage makes it even more challenging. This paper proposes IVR virtualization task scheduling and computational resource sharing (among different IVR applications) strategies based on genetic algorithms, in which different objectives are optimized. The algorithms used by both strategies are simulated and the performance measured and analyzed.",

Nevertheless, a lack of holistic approaches, which support the entire product creation process, can be observed. Combining the advantages of different existing methods could enable a rather continuous decision support. This paper presents an analysis and a categorization of current tools. On this foundation a process-based approach for method selection and combination is derived. By determining the concrete output of a method it becomes possible to use this information for defining sustainability milestones in project management. Hence, the allocation of design methods to different phases of the product creation process can be performed more intuitively and a combination of methods is encouraged. In order to test this approach, an exemplary redesign of a turbocharger has been conducted. From a pool of 50 methods nine are systematically selected and applied in order to check whether the selection was successful or not. ",

Based on the measured concentrations of 137Cs in the sediment layers, the various transport parameters such as sedimentation rate, residence half- time, effective migration velocity, diffusion coefficient and the convective velocities were determined. The sedimentation rate was determined to be 1.61, 1.03 0.69 and 1.25 cm year -1 from the slope of lines obtained from the depth profile of 137Cs in cores using a least-square fitting method at site 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The mean residence half-times, ranging from 11 to 35 years were observed to be the highest at the upper layers (up to 8 cm) of all sites and decreased with sediment depth. Subsequently, the ranges of mean value of effective vertical migration velocity in the same layers were between 0.15 and 0.46 cm year-1. As expected, the vertical migration in the upper sediment layers was very slow and thereafter increased slowly in the succeeding layers (12 cm onwards) of all sites with a mean ranging from 1.11 to 4.13 cm year-1. The obtained migration velocities were quite higher than those reported in literatures for global fallout. The convective velocity and diffusion coefficient at each site were assumed to be constant in the whole depth and calculated under the assumption of steady state. Using a depth-zoned bioturbational mixing model, the estimated biological diffusion coefficients ranged from 7 \u00d7 10-7 to 3.8 \u00d7 10-6 cm 2 s-1 which were within the literature values reported for shallow coastal environments and deep sea.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Coastal and estuarine areas are among the most important places for human inhabitants [1]; however, with rapid urbanization and industrialization, heavy metals are continuously carried to the estuarine and coastal sediments from upstream of tributaries [2]-[5]. Heavy metal contamination in sediment could affect the water quality and bioaccumulation of metals in aquatic organisms, resulting in potential long-term implication on human health and ecosystem [6]-[7]. In most circumstances, the major part of the anthropogenic metal load in the sea and seabed sediments has a terrestrial source, from mining and industrial developments along major rivers and estuaries [8]-[10]. The hot spots of heavy metal concentration are often near industrial plants [11]. Heavy metal emissions have been declining in some industrialized countries over the last few decades [12], [13], however, anthropogenic sources have been increasing with rapid industrialization and urbanization in developing countries [14], [15]. Heavy metal contaminations in sediment could affect the water quality, the bioassimilation and bioaccumulation of metals in aquatic organisms, resulting in potential long-term affects on human health and ecosystem [16]-[19]. Quantification of the land-derived metal fluxes to the sea is therefore a key factor to ascertain at which extent those inputs can influence the natural biogeochemical processes of the elements in the marine [20], [21]. The spatial distribution of heavy metals in marine sediments is of major importance in determining the pollution history of aquatic systems [22], [23], and is basic information for identifying the possible sources of contamination and to delineate the areas where its concentration exceeds the threshold values and the strategies of site remediation [24]. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of accumulation and geochemical distribution of heavy metals in sediments is crucial for the management of coastal environment.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Petroleum hydrocarbons are among the most important contaminants in aquatic ecosystems, but the effects of different petroleum components on the archaeal communities in these environments are still poorly investigated. Therefore, the effects of representative alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and crude oil on archaeal communities from marine (Massambaba Beach) and hypersaline waters (Vermelha Lagoon) from the Massambaba Environmental Protection Area, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were examined in this study. Hydrocarbon contamination was simulated in vitro, and the resulting microcosms were temporally analyzed (4, 12 and 32 days after contamination) using molecular methods. DNA and RNA extractions were followed by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analyses and by the further molecular identification of selected DGGE bands. Archaeal communities could not be detected in the marine microcosms after contamination with the different hydrocarbons. In contrast, they were detected by DNA- and RNA-based methods in hypersaline water. Dendrogram analyses of PCR-DGGE showed that the archaeal communities in the hypersaline water-derived microcosms selected for by the addition of heptadecane, naphthalene or crude oil differed from the natural ones observed before the hydrocarbon contaminations. Principal coordinate analysis of the DGGE patterns showed an important effect of incubation time on the archaeal communities. A total of 103 DGGE bands were identified, and phylogenetic analysis showed that 84.4 % and 15.5 % of these sequences were associated with the Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota groups, respectively. Most of the sequences obtained were related to uncultivated archaea. Using redundancy analysis, the response of archaeal communities to the type of hydrocarbon contamination used could also be observed in the hypersaline water-derived microcosms. ",

After each fishing operation, catch composition was quantified and precise information about the position of the catch was taken between 2008 and 2011. Macromedusae records have been systemized in order to analyze the spatial-temporal distribution, the areas of concentration of the identified species and their relationship with other components of the bycatch. Catch composition analyzed in 986 fishing tows, demonstrated that the participation of these organisms ranged from 6-16%, and the hydromedusae Rhacostoma atlanticum L. Agassiz, 1851 and Olindias sambaquiensis M\u00fcller, 1861 were the most abundant and widely distributed species. R. atlanticum was recorded between 20 and 140 m deep while O. sambaquiensis presented registers in shallower waters between 10 and 70 m. No other identified species has been recorded in depths greater than 60 m. Areas of high concentration included the north-central coast of Santa Catarina and Paran\u00e1, the northern part of S\u00e3o Paulo and the north-central portion of Rio Grande do Sul State. Although the participation of the macromedusae has been relatively low, in areas of elevated concentration, the relative importance was high, making its participation almost exclusive among other zoological groups. Those registers of abundance and the respective areas of high concentration of macromedusae, which were associated to high primary production sites, may serve as a theoretical reference of the abundance of these organisms for future studies that aim to evaluate possible changes in jellyfish populations.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Objectives: To analyze multi-source data including awards, publications, patents and drugs, and try to draw the whole landscape of the research and development community in the area of natural products (NPs) against cancer. Materials and Methods: Awards, publications, patents and drugs data from National Institute of Health/Natural Science Foundation of China (NIH/NSFC), PubMed, Derwent Innovation Index and Cortellis were collected. Bibliometric methodologies and technology are used to investigate publications/patents/drugs, their contents and relationships. Results: NIH and NSFC respectively demonstrated a stable and sustained expenditure growth in this area. The number of publications is continuously increasing. Yet the annual patent applications worldwide and FDA drug approvals were little changed or not obviously fluctuated in 2003-2013. USA and several Asia-pacific countries/territories are important contributing powers. We described the evolution of major research topics by those MeSH Major Topics indexed in PubMed with the largest growth range in three intervals, and analyzed hot research topics in the recent 10 years which include NPs or NPs derivatives, cell line/animal model, laboratory technologies and activation mechanisms. Conclusions: China published the most publications and received the most patent applications, but drug discovery performance is no better than USA and Japan. Research on anti-neoplastic structures and compounds originated from Chinese traditional medicine (TCM), medicinal plants, herbal medicine and marine NPs are major research topics in the recent 10 years. There still exits translational gap between basic research and drug discovery. Translational research should be undertaken to strengthen the applicability of NPs.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The alpine steppe covers 700,000km2 on the central and western Tibetan Plateau, constituting a large portion of China's total grassland ecosystem. Yet, limited effort has been made to quantify its greenhouse gas fluxes and examine how they will respond to increased reactive N deposition. Therefore, we conducted an experiment to simulate an elevated level of N deposition (10kg Nha-1a-1) to investigate the variability in GHG fluxes and their responses to the N treatment. Three years of measurements showed that: (1) CO2 efflux was 132.7\u00b120.1mgm-2h-1 during the growing season, while CH4 uptake was -60.0\u00b17.1\u03bcgm-2h-1. The alpine steppe acted as a weak source of N2O (0.14\u00b10.38\u03bcgm-2h-1), but neither soil moisture nor temperature explained its variation. (2) Simulated N deposition significantly enhanced the plant community in the alpine steppe in terms of leaf tissue N content. However, neither the seasonal pattern nor the CO2 efflux and CH4 uptake were significantly affected by the N additions, and the emission factors (EFs) of N2O varied from 0.16 to 0.85% (0.56\u00b10.20%).Our consecutive observations quantify the alpine steppe ecosystem of the Tibetan Plateau as a vital CH4 sink. The lower EFs of N2O in the simulated N deposition experiment confirm previous measurements at temperate grassland sites in China, implying a potential overestimation of N2O emissions based on the IPCC default.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Canada yew (Taxus canadensis Marsh.) is a gymnosperm shrub that occurs in the understorey of coniferous and deciduous forests throughout the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. Canada yew foliage contains high concentrations of paclitaxel and other taxanes, which have proven effective in treating many forms of cancer. A major challenge to the sustainable management of wild Canada yew harvest is the lack of a spatial inventory of the resource. The objective of this study was to develop a spatial model to predict the distribution and abundance of Canada yew populations in a forest landscape representative of the boreal forest region of Ontario, Canada. The study was conducted in the Romeo Mallete Forest (RMF) located on the southern edge of the boreal forest west of Timmins, Ontario. Abundance of Canada yew populations was assessed in 140 circular sample plots (5541 m2), established at locations throughout the RMF. Canada yew abundance in each sample plot was estimated as the mean percent cover of three randomly located 100 m2 subplots. Predictor variables were extracted from the Forest Resources Inventory (FRI) of the RMF, and from layers derived from remote sensing data covering the study area. A combination of classification and regression trees with Random Forests analysis was used to develop a classification model for FRI polygons based on patterns of Canada yew abundance, and assess the performance of the model. The classification error rate on the presence/absence model was approximately 21%, and the root mean squared error on the best continuous cover model was 9.1%. In all analyses, the most important classification node was based on percent basal area of the shade-tolerant late successional species Balsam Fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill), which suggests that patterns of Canada yew abundance are driven largely by time since disturbance. . All rights reserved.",

Using self- and partner-reports, 30 perpetrators (28 males) and 30 victims (29 females) of partner violence, including 23 (former) couples, were interviewed. Results showed that perpetrators (i.e., males) were higher on antisocial personality traits than victims (i.e., females), but the two groups did not differ on borderline traits and self-reported violence. Moreover, borderline traits were associated with partner violence in general, whereas antisocial personality traits were associated with physical, but not psychological, partner violence. Analyses on (former) couples suggest that there is little congruence between perpetrators' and victims' reports of partner violence. In conclusion, the findings of the current study not only emphasized the complex nature of intimate partner violence but also showed that dysfunctional personality traits and gender play a significant role in both the display and reporting of partner violence.

The Chinese government may have been building a legal system for decades, yet this system lacks transparency, accountability, and due process. It is not surprising, therefore, that Chinese citizens are increasingly resorting to contentious means in their struggles for a more just society. The Internet answers an immediate social need. It provides a new medium for citizens to speak up, link up, and act up against power, corruption, and social injustice. In this way, the Internet has influenced the development of civil society and given expression to grassroots impulses for political reform. No analysis of political change in contemporary China can afford to ignore these social forces. The goal of this chapter is to provide an empirical assessment of how the use of the Internet has influenced civil society development and thereby contributed, in explicit and implicit ways, to popular struggles for a more just society.",

The results show that the direct costs of waste recycling will be higher than the landfill, and increasing waste disposal fees may be incentive to reduce waste generation, but it must rely on strict law enforcement, because it increase the risk of illegal landfill; financial subsidy to recycling center is not a long-term policy, because it cannot stimulate technological innovation and cost savings; reasonable government purchasing has a immense potential for improving the application of recycling products by guiding the construction market.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Background: The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 resulted in a transition from centrally planned socialist systems to largely free-market systems for post-Soviet states. The health systems of Central Asian Post-Soviet (CAPS) countries (Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) have undergone a profound revolution. External development partners have been crucial to this reorientation through financial and technical support, though both relationships and outcomes have varied. This research provides a comparative review of the development assistance provided in the health systems of CAPS countries and proposes future policy options to improve the effectiveness of development. Design: Extensive documentary review was conducted using Pubmed, Medline/Ovid, Scopus, and Google scholar search engines, local websites, donor reports, and grey literature. The review was supplemented by key informant interviews and participant observation. Findings: The collapse of the Soviet dominance of the region brought many health system challenges. Donors have played an essential role in the reform of health systems. However, as new aid beneficiaries, neither CAPS countries' governments nor the donors had the experience of development collaboration in this context. The scale of development assistance for health in CAPS countries has been limited compared to other countries with similar income, partly due to their limited history with the donor community, lack of experience in managing donors, and a limited history of transparency in international dealings. Despite commonalities at the start, two distinctive trajectories formed in CAPS countries, due to their differing politics and governance context. Conclusions: The influence of donors, both financially and technically, remains crucial to health sector reform, despite their relatively small contribution to overall health budgets. Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Tajikistan have demonstrated more effective development cooperation and improved health outcomes; arguably, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have made slower progress in their health and socio-economic indices because of their resistance to open and accountable development relationships.",

Using multilevel modeling techniques, our results offer support for Anderson's arguments. Specifically, we found that perception of police discrimination is significantly related to adopting the street code. In addition, this relationship was conditioned by neighborhood-level violence.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Field and greenhouse studies examined the effects of growth habit and chloroplast presence in leaf veins for their role in increasing agronomic water use efficiency and yields of California modern processing tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cultivars. Five introgression lines (ILs), made with Solanum pennellii Cor. in the genetic background of cultivar M82, differ in genes that map to a region on Chromosome 5, including the SP5G gene (determinate vs. semideterminate (Det vs. SemiDet)) and the obv gene (presence (obscure) vs. absence (clear) of leaf vein chloroplasts (Obs vs. Clr)). The five ILs and M82 represented three of the four gene combinations (Det-Clr was unavailable). Det-Obs ILs had less leaf, stem and total aboveground biomass with earlier fruit set and ripening than SemiDet-Clr ILs. By harvest, total fruit biomass was not different among ILs. Photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance were 4-7% and 13-26% higher, respectively, in Det-Obs ILs than SemiDet-Clr ILs. SemiDet-Obs ILs were intermediate for growth and gas exchange variables. The Det-Obs ILs had lower leaf N concentration and similar chlorophyll content per leaf area (but slightly higher per leaf mass) than SemiDet-Clr ILs. The Obs trait was associated with gains in leaf gas exchange-related traits. This study suggests that a more compact growth habit, less leaf biomass and higher C assimilation capacity per leaf area were relevant traits for the increased yields in cultivars with determinate growth. Developing new introgression libraries would contribute to understanding the multiple trait effects of desirable phenotypes. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Comprehensive analysis of parameter and driver sensitivity is key to establishing the credibility of models representing complex systems. This is especially so for models of natural systems where experimental manipulation of the real-world to provide controlled validation data is not possible. End-to-end ecosystem models (nutrients to birds and mammals) of marine ecosystems fall into this category with applications for evaluating the effects of climate change and fishing on nutrient fluxes and the abundances of flora and fauna. Here we present results of both 'one-at-a-time' (OAT) and variance based global sensitivity analyses (GSA) of the fish and fishery aspects of StrathE2E, an end-to-end ecosystem model of the North Sea. The sensitivity of the model was examined with respect to internal biological parameters, and external drivers related to climate and human activity. The OAT Morris method was first used to screen for factors most influential on model outputs. The Sobol GSA method was then used to calculate quantitative sensitivity indices. The results indicated that the fish and shellfish components of the model (demersal and pelagic fish, filter/deposit and scavenge/carnivore feeding benthos) were influenced by different sets of factors. Harvesting rates were highly influential on demersal and pelagic fish biomasses. Suspension/deposit feeding benthos were directly sensitive to changes in temperature, while the temperature acted indirectly on pelagic fish through the connectivity between model components of the food web. Biomass conversion efficiency was the most important factor for scavenge/carnivorous feeding benthos. The results indicate the primacy of fishing as the most important process affecting total fish biomass, together with varying responses to environmental factors which may be relevant in the context of climate change. The non-linear responses and parameter interactions identified by the analysis also highlight the necessity to use global rather than local methods for the sensitivity analysis of ecosystem models.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Research on the housing choice voucher program and housing mobility interventions shows that even with assistance, it is difficult for poor minority families to relocate to, and remain in, low-poverty neighborhoods. Scholars suggest that both structural forces and individual preferences help explain these residential patterns. However, less attention is paid to where preferences come from, and how they respond to policies and social structure to shape residential decisionmaking. In this paper, we use data from fieldwork with 110 participants in the Baltimore Mobility Program (BMP), an assisted mobility voucher program, to demonstrate how residential preferences can shift over time as a function of living in higher opportunity neighborhoods. Since 2003, BMP has helped over 2,000 low-income African American families move from high-poverty, highly segregated neighborhoods in Baltimore City to low-poverty, racially mixed neighborhoods throughout the Baltimore region. Along with intensive counseling and unique program administration, these new neighborhood contexts helped many women to shift what we term residential choice frameworks: the criteria that families use to assess housing and neighborhoods. Parents who participated in the mobility program raised their expectations for what neighborhoods, homes, and schools can provide for their children and themselves. Parents report new preferences for the quiet of suburban locations, and strong consideration of school quality and neighborhood diversity when thinking about where to live. Our findings suggest that housing policies should employ counseling to ensure relocation to and sustained residence in low-poverty communities. Our work also underscores how social structure, experience, and policy opportunities influence preferences, and how these preferences, in turn, affect policy outcomes. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Active frontages are often advocated in best practice guidance and by local planning authorities. However, little research has been carried out to establish what benefits, if any, active frontages offer. Previous research in this area has been limited to examining observed behaviour rather than analysing public perceptions. This article aims to improve the understanding of the relationship between the quality of an active frontage and public perceptions of the public space the frontage addresses. The research was carried out through a combination of a critical literature review and a questionnaire survey that engaged 152 participants. The participants' perceptions of a range of public spaces in relation to a number of frontages were investigated using comparison and correlation. The results suggest that the quality of an active frontage can significantly affect people's perceptions of a public space in terms of its safety, comfort, sociability and liveliness. Good-quality active frontages can contribute to creating successful public spaces, which can help deliver far-reaching benefits for towns and cities.

The state of urban resources and environment directly affects the size and speed of urbanization, while urbanization development has some adverse effects on resources and environment, too. This research indicates that, under the constraints of limited resources and environment, China must take the road of sustainable urbanization. However, the core of sustainable urbanization is to promote urban green planning, construction and development. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the ecology-oriented development of the industries and the communities in the cities. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Objective: Early studies in Cape Town identified independent HIV-1 epidemics, with distinct viral subtypes, among men who have sex with men (MSM) and the heterosexual population. However, few recent HIV-1 subtype data are available for MSM in South Africa. We examined HIV-1 subtypes among MSM in Cape Town. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Methods: Self-identified MSM were recruited from geographically and racially disparate communities across Cape Town. Participants completed behavioral questionnaires and underwent HIV testing. Virus isolated from infected participants underwent complete env gp160 sequencing, and HIV-1 subtypes were assigned through phylogenetic analysis. Results: In total, 194 HIV-infected MSM were enrolled: 67% black African, 24% colored, and 9% white men. More black African men identified as bisexual or heterosexual compared with other races. Overall, 31%-66% of men reported a recent partner of another race. HIV-1 subtypes were confirmed for 143 participants: 81% were subtype C, 14% B, 1% A1, 1% F2, and 3 recombinant viruses. Subtype C virus was associated with black African race (P = 0.003 compared with colored; P > 0.001 compared with white), men who identified as bisexual/heterosexual (P = 0.01), and reported a female sexual partner in the last year (P = 0.02). Compared with previous studies, an increasing prevalence of subtype C virus was noted among white MSM. Conclusions: This molecular epidemiology study provides novel evidence of sexual network links between the heterosexual and MSM epidemics and between historically racially disparate communities. These findings provide insights into the drivers of HIV epidemics in different population groups and may have implications for prevention strategies. ",

The environmental impact indicators considered in the present paper include global warming potential (GWP, CO2 equivalent), acidification potential (AP, SO2 equivalent) and eutrophication potential (EP, NO3 equivalent). Different weighting techniques have been used to present and evaluate the environmental characteristics of bio-diesel. With the assistance of normalization values, the eco-efficiency was demonstrated in this work. The results indicate that the energy consumption of bio-diesel production is lowest in Jatropha while AP and EP are more in case of Jatropha than that of Rapeseed and Palm oil.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Tactile stimuli provide animals with important information about the environment, including physical features such as obstacles, and biologically relevant cues related to food, mates, hosts and predators. The antennae, the principal sensory organs of insects, house an array of sensory receptors for olfaction, gustation, audition, nociception, balance, stability, graviception, static electric fields, and thermo-, hygro- and mechanoreception. The antennae, being the anteriormost sensory appendages, play a prominent role in social interactions with conspecifics that involve primarily chemosensory and tactile stimuli. In the German cockroach (Blattella germanica) antennal contact during social interactions modulates brain-regulated juvenile hormone production, ultimately accelerating the reproductive rate in females. The primary sensory modality mediating this social facilitation of reproduction is antennal mechanoreception. We investigated the key elements, or stimulus features, of antennal contact that socially facilitate reproduction in B. germanica females. Using motor-driven antenna mimics, we assessed the physiological responses of females to artificial tactile stimulation. Our results indicate that tactile stimulation with artificial materials, some deviating significantly from the native antennal morphology, can facilitate female reproduction. However, none of the artificial stimuli matched the effects of social interactions with a conspecific female.  All rights reserved.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Objective: One of the indicators critical to the success of violence reduction programmes among female sex workers (FSWs) is the pattern of disclosure of violence. This study examines the rate of non-disclosure of violence among FSWs in India by perpetrators of violence and programme exposure. Methods: Data were drawn from a cross-sectional study conducted among FSWs in 2009 across four states of India: Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The analytical sample included 1341 FSWs who experienced physical violence in past six months. Multilevel logistic regression stratified by state was conducted to examine predictors of non-disclosure. Results: About 54% of FSWs did not disclose their experience of violence to anyone with considerable variations in the pattern of disclosure across states. Another 36% of FSWs shared the experience with NGO worker/peer. Compared to violence perpetrated by paying partners/stranger, that by non-paying partner were twice more likely to report nondisclosure (53% vs. 68%, Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 1.8, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.3-2.4). Similarly, FSWs who were not registered with an NGO/sex worker collective were 40% more likely to report non-disclosure of violence against those registered (58% vs. 53%, AOR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.9). Conclusions: Non-disclosure of physical violence is quite high among FSWs which can be a barrier to the success of violence reduction efforts. Immediate efforts are required to understand the reasons behind non-disclosure based on which interventions can be developed. Community collectivisation and designing gender-based interventions with the involvement of non-paying partners should be the way forward. ",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Background and Methods: To guide achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, we used the Lives Saved Tool to provide a novel simulation of potential maternal, fetal, and newborn lives and costs saved by scaling up midwifery and obstetrics services, including family planning, in 58 low- and middle-income countries. Typical midwifery and obstetrics interventions were scaled to either 60% of the national population (modest coverage) or 99% (universal coverage). Findings: Under even a modest scale-up, midwifery services including family planning reduce maternal, fetal, and neonatal deaths by 34%. Increasing midwifery alone or integrated with obstetrics is more cost-effective than scaling up obstetrics alone; when family planning was included, the midwifery model was almost twice as cost-effective as the obstetrics model, at $2,200 versus $4,200 per death averted. The most effective strategy was the most comprehensive: increasing midwives, obstetricians, and family planning could prevent 69% of total deaths under universal scale-up, yielding a cost per death prevented of just $2,100. Within this analysis, the interventions which midwifery and obstetrics are poised to deliver most effectively are different, with midwifery benefits delivered across the continuum of pre-pregnancy, prenatal, labor and delivery, and postpartum-postnatal care, and obstetrics benefits focused mostly on delivery. Including family planning within each scope of practice reduced the number of likely births, and thus deaths, and increased the cost-effectiveness of the entire package (e.g., a 52% reduction in deaths with midwifery and obstetrics increased to 69% when family planning was added; cost decreased from $4,000 to $2,100 per death averted). Conclusions: This analysis suggests that scaling up midwifery and obstetrics could bring many countries closer to achieving mortality reductions. Midwives alone can achieve remarkable mortality reductions, particularly when they also perform family planning services - the greatest return on investment occurs with the scale-up of midwives and obstetricians together.

    "abstract_cleaned": "To study the effect of water quality and operating parameters on membrane fouling, a comparative analysis of wastewater (WW) and seawater (SW) fouled reverse osmosis (RO) membranes was conducted. Membranes were harvested from SWRO and WWRO pilot plants located in Vilaseca (East Spain), both using ultrafiltration as pretreatment. The SWRO unit was fed with Mediterranean seawater and the WWRO unit was operated using secondary effluent collected from the municipal wastewater treatment plant. Lead and terminal SWRO and WWRO modules were autopsied after five months and three months of operation, respectively. Ultrastructural, chemical, and microbiological analyses of the fouling layers were performed. Results showed that the WWRO train had mainly bio/organic fouling at the lead position element and inorganic fouling at terminal position element, whereas SWRO train had bio/organic fouling at both end position elements. In the case of WWRO membranes, Betaproteobacteria was the major colonizing species; while Ca, S, and P were the major present inorganic elements. The microbial population of SWRO membranes was mainly represented by Alpha and Gammaproteobacteria. Ca, Fe, and S were the main identified inorganic elements of the fouling layer of SWRO membranes. These results confirmed that the RO fouling layer composition is strongly impacted by the source water quality. .",

We used a capital asset framework to evaluate PES programmes in terms of their social, environmental, economic and institutional outcomes, focusing on efficiency, effectiveness and equity trade-offs. We found that PES schemes can provide positive conservation and development outcomes with respect to livelihoods, land-use change, household and community incomes, and governance. However, programmes differ with regards to contract agreements, payment modes, and compliance, and have diverse cross-sector institutional arrangements that remain primarily state-structured and external donor-financed. There is a consistent lack of focus on evaluating and fostering human, social and institutional capital. This reflects general inattention to how PES programmes consider the causal links between ES and outcomes. To enhance ES production and PES scheme accessibility and participation, we recommend strengthening the linkages between ES production and land-use practices, boosting private and voluntary sector involvement, encouraging property rights and tenure reform, improving financial viability, and adequately accounting for the distribution of programme costs and benefits among participants.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Although ecodesign is a well-defined concept in the literature, the potential exists to increase its use and effectiveness in practice and in the company context. By searching for new approaches that could foster ecodesign application, this article explores the points of intersection between ecodesign and project management. The research approach combines a systematic literature review with a case study conducted at a consumer goods manufacturer that is recognised as a relevant benchmark in sustainability commitment and practices. The analysis of the literature reveals that project management principles are addressed in a limited manner in specialised articles on ecodesign, and no specific articles on project management were found that address issues of environmental product development and environmental sustainability. The case study indicates that environmental requirements interfere with project management, thus creating new challenges for the project teams. This study reveals that the gap identified between the two areas of knowledge can be considered as a missing link that, if filled, could enhance the effectiveness of ecodesign in the product development process. This new link would complement the current ecodesign approaches that focus on technical tools and organisational aspects by introducing original and useful guidelines for sustainable project management. .

    "abstract_cleaned": "Cyanobacteria blooms are since early times a cause for environmental concern because of their negative impact through the release of odors, water discoloration, and more dangerously through the release of toxic compounds (i.e. the cyanotoxins) that can affect both human and animal welfare. Surveillance of the aquatic ecosystems is therefore obligatory, and methods to achieve such require a prompt answer not only regarding the species that are producing the blooms but also the cyanotoxins that are being produced and/or released. Moreover, besides this well-known source of possible intoxication, it has been demonstrated the existence of several other potential routes of exposure, either for humans or other biota such as through food additives and in terrestrial environments (in plants, lichens, biological soil crusts) and the recognition of their harmful impact on less studied ecosystems (e.g. coral reefs). Nowadays, the most frequent approaches to detect toxic cyanobacteria and/or their toxins are the chemical-, biochemical-, and molecular-based methods. Above their particular characteristics and possible applications, they all bring to the environmental monitoring several aspects that are needed to be discussed and scrutinized. The end outcome of this review will be to provide newer insights and recommendations regarding the methods needed to apply in an environmental risk assessment program. Therefore, a current state of the knowledge concerning the three methodological approaches will be presented, while highlighting positive and negative aspects of each of those methods within the purpose of monitoring or studying cyanobacteria and their toxins in the environment.",

We used multilevel logistic regression analysis to assess the variability in physical violence against unmarried female adolescents at the community level and to explore the role of community-level characteristics in explaining this variability. The data for this analysis were taken from a 2005 nationally representative survey of 20,000 adolescents aged 10 to 24 living in Bangladesh. Data from 4,370 unmarried female adolescents were included in the final model. Results: Communities in Bangladesh have, on average, high levels of physical violence against unmarried female adolescents, and these levels vary widely across communities. Community-level acceptance of physical punishment against adolescents was related to unmarried female adolescents' risk of experiencing physical violence. Conclusions: It is important to find and target communities in which unmarried adolescent girls are at higher risk of experiencing physical violence. Programs and policies must focus specifically on changing attitudes regarding treatment of women and girls. As these attitudes accepting of physical violence are found in adolescents aged 10 to 19, school and community-based programs should particularly target this age group.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Temperature changes due to climate change and seasonal fluctuation can have profound implications on chemical toxicity to marine organisms. Through a comprehensive meta-analysis by comparing median lethal or effect concentration data of six chemicals for various saltwater species obtained at different temperatures, we reveal that the chemical toxicity generally follows two different models: (1) it increases with increasing temperature and (2) it is the lowest at an optimal temperature and increases with increasing or decreasing temperature from the optimal temperature. Such observations are further supported by temperature-dependent hazardous concentration 10% (HC10) values derived from species sensitivity distributions which are constructed using the acute toxicity data generated at different temperatures. Considering these two models and natural variations of seawater temperature, we can scientifically assess whether applying an assessment factor (e.g. 10) to modify water quality guidelines of the chemicals can adequately protect marine ecosystems in tropics, subtropics and temperate regions, respectively.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Studies of language aptitude in young learners are scarce. However, it may be claimed that in the current revitalization of language aptitude age-related concerns have played a significant role. It has been argued that language aptitude, in particular analytical abilities, is associated to high attainment in late learners, thereby providing an explanation for those cases of successful late learners that challenge the critical period hypothesis (DeKeyser 2000). However, recent research has found that language aptitude also seems to have an explanatory role for young starters (Abrahamsson and Hyltenstam 2008; Gra\u00f1ena 2012). In that respect, Mu\u00f1oz and Singleton (2011) have suggested that a research question needing further elucidation is whether a high level of language learning aptitude is a prerequisite for high levels of proficiency in late learners only. Accordingly, this chapter presents a study that examines whether language learning aptitude, as measured by the Elementary Modern Language Aptitude Test, is significantly associated with proficiency in a group of Spanish-Catalan bilingual learners of English. Participants are 48 primary school children in fifth and sixth grades (ages 10\u201311 and 11\u201312). Specifically, the study compares the strength of the association between aptitude scores with speaking skills and with listening, reading and writing skills, as well as the relationship between the different aptitude components and those skills. The results show significant correlations with all language dimensions, although the predictive value of the aptitude test seems weaker for speaking. The results also highlight the role played by grammatical sensitivity in relation to writing outcomes.",

The potential for extractives to drive economic structural transformation is intuitively attractive, the Africa Mining Vision (2009) document providing a primary template. Geological inheritance alone, however, is not a panacea for economic development, industrialization or poverty alleviation. While much attention to the \u2018resource curse\u2019 has identified the problem of excessive rent-seeking and the consequent impact on elite consolidation, democracy, governance and macroeconomic distortions, a more fundamental problem, the \u2018other resource curse\u2019, may be an overlooked driver: a lingering assumption that mineral resources should straightforwardly provide significant revenue streams for public goods, inputs for industrial transformation, and extensive employment. Geology alone is neither conducive nor antithetical to economic development.

    "abstract_cleaned": "The security and quality of livelihoods for peasant households is the core issue for rural areas in China. A stable livelihood contributes to the harmonious development of related polices, poverty eradication and sustainable use of resources. In Qinghe County, located in the extremely arid zone of Northwest China, 238 validated surveys were conducted. The analysis focuses on the importance of livelihood capitals for the selection of on- or off-farm livelihood strategies among beneficiaries of different kinds of ecological compensation packages. The goal is to see if different groups of beneficiaries are better able to pursue off-farm livelihoods activity, which reduces pressure on the resource base, and whether specific capitals are especially effective in helping households pursue off-farm livelihoods, which benefits their well-being. The findings show that proportionally more herdsmen (who participated in a pastureland rehabilitation program) were able to pursue off-farm livelihoods than farmers (who participated in the cultivated land reforestation program), and especially agro-pastoralists (who participated in both programs). Further, models of livelihood strategy show that human and financial capitals facilitate off-farm livelihoods, while productive capital tends to lead to on-farm livelihoods. These findings indicate that there is no single determinant of livelihood strategy, and future policies must consciously differentiate among beneficiaries to reach the desired result.",

The main findings indicate that while women's labor allocation to economic activities is comparable to that of men, household chores and care work are almost entirely women's responsibility. The heavy burden of responsibilities leave women significantly time-poorer compared to men. Women's time-poverty worsens when the burden of simultaneous care work is taken into account. In addition, due to multitasking, the work tends to be more taxing. The examination of determinants of time-poverty shows that common measures of individual economic power, such as assets and education, do not necessarily affect the time-poverty faced by women.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for peripheral artery disease. Life expectancy is 41months for diabetic patients with an ischemic ulcer. The characteristics of diabetic arteriopathy make its treatment more difficult than in non-diabetic patients. Few data are available about the surgical treatment of arteriopathy in diabetic patients (including angioplasty or bypass), especially in case of distal arteriopathy. The choice of the procedure depends on multiple factors such as the disease localization, its extent, distal blood flow and vascular disease-related surgical risk. The principal aim of revascularisation is to restore direct flow to the foot in order to ensure wound healing and limb salvage. With percutaneous endoluminal angioplasty, limb salvage can be achieved in more than 80% of patients at 1-3years. The percutaneous procedure is less invasive than open surgery, there are fewer complications, and morbidity and mortality rates are reduced; moreover, a second procedure remains possible in the future. With bypass surgery, the rate of limb salvage exceeds 80% at five years. Nevertheless, peri-operative mortality reaches 3% and arterial anatomy, patient-related risks factors or venous graft availability may be limitations. New endovascular techniques especially designed for the distal arteries of the lower limbs enable very distal revascularization with morbidity and mortality rates lower than with surgery.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Dronedarone has been demonstrated to be harmful in patients with recent decompensated heart failure. Furthermore, a PALLAS study reported that dronedarone therapy increases mortality rates in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation. Although a pathophysiological explanation for these finding remains to be elucidated, the long term effects of dronedarone on myocardial structure and stability have been suggested. The aim of the present study was to determine whether dronedarone therapy affects left ventricular (LV) function in a chronic model of myocardial infarction (MI). An anterior MI was induced in 16 pigs. Of these animals, eight pigs were then treated with dronedarone for 1 week prior to, and 4 weeks following MI, the remaining pigs served as controls. LV angiography was performed 4 weeks after MI to determine the LV ejection fraction (LVEF). A post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging scan of the LV was then performed on the two groups (n=6) to determine the volume and size of the induced MI. Dronedarone therapy did not affect systemic and intracardiac hemodynamic parameters or LVEF during the follow-up assessment. Of note, dronedarone had no negative effect on the total infarct volume and size and did not induce lethal proarrhythmic effects following the induced anterior MI. Therefore, the results suggested that dronedarone did not increase the volume or size of induced anterior MI and did not affect LV performance. Thus, dronedarone therapy was observed to be safe in a porcine model of anterior MI.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The early skills of Emergent Literacy include the knowledge and abilities related to the alphabet, phonological awareness, symbolic representation, and communication. However, existing models of emergent literacy focus on discrete skills and miss the perspective of the surrounding environment. Early literacy skills, including their relationship to one another, and the substantial impact of the setting and context, are critical in ensuring that children gain all of the preliminary skills and awareness they will need to become successful readers and writers. Research findings over the last few decades have led to a fuller understanding of all that emergent literacy includes, resulting in a need for a new, more comprehensive model. A new model, described in this article, strives to explain how emergent literacy can be viewed as an interactive process of skills and context rather than a linear series of individual components. Early literacy learning opportunities are more likely to happen when teachers have a solid knowledge base of emergent literacy and child development. Research has shown that preschool teachers with limited knowledge about literacy development are significantly less able to provide such experiences for children. Teachers will be better able to facilitate all of the components of emergent literacy if they have access to, and understanding of, a model that describes the components, their interactions, and the importance of environmental factors in supporting children.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "In recent decades, legal Acts, norms, and regulations have proliferated in order to ensure equal opportunities for women and men in multiple contexts, including public and private organizations. Nevertheless, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that, to date, real and legal equality do not match. The current context of the global economy suggests that there may now be a new barrier, related to the fact that women have been partially excluded from positions abroad which would facilitate the acquisition of professional and personal skills which are essential in the present century. This new inequality in access to senior management seems to be in contradiction with the different pressures and initiatives put in place to achieve equality of opportunities between women and men, protected in our national and international laws. In this paper, the main causes excluding women from international assignments, and consequently from senior management, are reviewed, highlighting the motivational and legal aftereffects that this trend may have. En las \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas han proliferado diversas disposiciones legales y normativas con el objetivo de garantizar la igualdad de oportunidades entre mujeres y hombres en m\u00faltiples contextos, entre ellos el que ata\u00f1e a las organizaciones p\u00fablicas y privadas. Pese a ello, existe suficiente evidencia de que la igualdad real no se acerca, hasta la fecha, a la legal. El contexto actual de econom\u00eda globalizada sugiere que puede aparecer una nueva barrera, al quedar la mujer excluida parcialmente de puestos en el extranjero que le facilitan la adquisici\u00f3n de capacidades profesionales y personales imprescindibles en el siglo actual. Esta nueva desigualdad en el acceso a puestos de alta direcci\u00f3n no parece responder a las distintas presiones e iniciativas por conseguir la igualdad de oportunidades entre hombres y mujeres, protegida en nuestro ordenamiento jur\u00eddico nacional e internacional. En este trabajo revisamos las principales causas que alejan a la mujer de los puestos internacionales y, en consecuencia, de la alta direcci\u00f3n, resaltando las derivaciones motivacionales y legales que dicha tendencia pudiese tener.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Moore's law and the continuity of device scaling have led to an increasing number of cores/nodes on a chip, creating a need for new mechanisms to achieve high-performance and power-efficient Network-on- Chip (NoC). Nanophotonics based NoCs provide for higher bandwidth and more power efficient designs than electronic networks. Present approaches often use an external laser source, ring resonators, and waveguides. However, they still suffer from important limitations: large static power consumption, and limited network scalability. In this article, we explore the use of emergingmolecular scale devices to construct nanophotonic networks: Molecular-scale Network-on-Chip (mNoC). We leverage on-chip emitters such as quantum dot LEDs, which provide electrical to optical signal modulation, and chromophores, which provide optical signal filtering for receivers. These devices replace the ring resonators and the external laser source used in contemporary nanophotonic NoCs. They reduce energy consumption or enable scaling to larger crossbars for a reduced energy budget. We present a Single Writer Multiple Reader (SWMR) bus based crossbar mNoC. Our evaluation shows that an mNoC can achieve more than 88% reduction in energy for a 64 \u00d7 64 crossbar compared to similar ring resonator based designs. Additionally, an mNoC can scale to a 256 \u00d7 256 crossbar with an average 10% performance improvement and 54% energy reduction.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Copyright 2015, Society of Petroleum Engineers.Since the industrial revolution in 18th century, people were always looking for more economical, more sustainable and - recently put into concerned about - more eco-friendly energy supply to fuel up the world economic growth. However the fact showed that the energy we consumed even became less affordable, less secure and less environmental sustainable for the last decades. World Economic Forum collaborating with Accenture formulated Energy Architecture Performance Index (EAPI) to provide more structural approach in understanding the condition of each country's energy system. Energy Architecture is defined as the integrated physical system of energy sources, carriers and demand sectors that are shaped by government, industry and civil society. Driven by the boundary constraints of economic development, geography and prosperity, countries are striving to find new and innovative ways to meet the demands of their energy system. The transition pathway from the current Energy Architecture to the new will look different for each country, with energy system objectives planned according to the trade-offs and complementarities surrounding the core imperatives of every energy system: managing risk to energy supplies while ensuring a country's economic, social and environmental well-being.",

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 This paper reviewed and categorised five knowledge management (KM) frameworks: first, KM foundation studies; second, resource-based view studies; third, IIC studies; fourth, competitive advantage (CA) studies; fifth, organisational information processing theory studies to propose research model. Case studies based on face-to-face interviews were conducted to empirically analyse the proposed research model. Findings \u2013 An inclusive research model was suggested to redress the key limitation of past studies in this research field. Research limitations/implications \u2013 Since Asian countries are at present heading for the creation of a knowledge economy, the present study is important to assist government and researchers to develop the most suitable information infrastructure for effective KM in the organisation. The research model proposed by the present study can also become a key reference to the governments and researchers in other developing countries towards the creation of knowledge economy. Practical implications \u2013 The model proposed by the present study will help organisations to examine the performance of their current information infrastructure towards developing new business processes, techniques and decisions for effective KM in the organisations. Originality/value \u2013 The present study is one of the pioneer studies that integrating important IICs such as the integrating capability, data management capability, security capability, utility capability and collaborating capability in the research framework to assist knowledge-based companies to enhance current KM practices and attain long-term CA.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Previous studies of the influences of land use/land cover changes (LULCC) on the climate of continental areas have provided a basis for our current understanding of LULCC impacts. However, continental climates may not provide complete explanations or answer specific scientific questions for other regions, such as small tropical-maritime dominated islands. Here we present a detailed analysis of temperature change over the past century for the tropical island of Puerto Rico, using an approach that accounts for internal climate variability and spatial resolution issues and assesses the degree to which some of this change might be related to urban development. Long-term weather data, digital maps, geographic information systems (GIS) and statistical analysis were used to detect and assess differences between urban and non-urban temperature records. Strong evidence of a relationship linking temperature magnitudes to local urban development was detected, and the analysis suggests that urbanization has increased minimum, maximum and average temperatures by 0.5 \u00b0C in the warmest regions to 2 \u00b0C in the coolest regions. The results also show that the magnitude of temperature impacts depends on the contextual ecology or environment where the development has occurred. Temperature differences between urban and non-urban areas are higher in colder and wetter microclimates than in dryer warmer ones, and were less pronounced for minimum temperature than for maximum temperature. However, because the levels of impacts are based on data that had some prior adjustment intended to control for urban signals, they represent minimum estimates of the impacts of land use on temperature in Puerto Rico.",

    "title": "Is there a role for subsurface lease in urban development to gain community support?",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Population growth, urbanization and technological developments may benefit from increased development of the subsurface. The possible uses of the subsurface however also result in fierce debates on societal needs, economic benefits and environmental impacts. Think for instance of siting land-based carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities like in Barendrecht, the Netherlands. The public opinion was strongly against it and as a result the project was canceled. This paper proposes a subsurface lease model to gain community support and better take costs and benefits into account from different stakeholders\u2019 perspectives. Sustainable development of the subsurface requires cooperation in a well-defined framework that on the one hand enables stakeholders to make their own choices, but also includes mechanisms to fully account for the costs and benefits to society, providing them feedback in order to reach a social optimum. Looking at the three pillars of sustainability (planet, people, profit) the societal dimension may well be the most challenging one in projects relating for example, to large scale subsurface construction, siting projects for the extraction of shale gas or injection such as carbon capture and storage. The viability of a subsurface leasing model is discussed as a policy option to gain public support over and above the required stakeholder consultations and risk communication to create a situation in which citizens feel that they have a stake in the chosen solution with a fair distribution of the costs and benefits to society. Multiple use of space can strongly benefit from such an alignment of stakeholders with seemingly opposing interests. The distribution of ownership is an important factor here, which can hinder the decision-making process involved in the use of the urban environment. Full ownership is not always feasible, especially in case of the multiple use of space. Therefore in day to day practice communication, stakeholder acceptance and (perceived) risks also have shown to be important factors in governance and the ability to reach decisions regarding subsurface development effectively.",

In Australia, community engagement is mandated at local government level across a wide range of policy and administrative issues, from health, to transport, to city planning. Numerous studies have, however, found that the reality falls well short of the ideal of meaningful citizen input into decision-making. Cases where government-sponsored processes have \u2018made a difference\u2019 are difficult to find. The reasons for this apparent failure have proved difficult to identify in detail. As a planned city with a highly educated population, Canberra should be a prime site for the involvement of citizens in many aspects of urban planning. The reality is that community engagement remains at the lower end of the scale of collaborative governance. Addressing this issue has led us to probe the nature of Australian Capital Territory governance and the developing contours of power in the city.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Conceptual design, steady state economic optimization, and decentralized plantwide control of a conventional reaction followed by separation process for continuous manufacture of monoisopropyl amine (MIPA) via the catalytic amination of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) is studied. A unique feature of the design is the recycle to extinction of the diisopropyl amine (DIPA) side product for a sustainable zero DIPA discharge process. The reactor effluent mixture separation is complicated by the presence of DIPA-water, IPA-water, and IPA-DIPA minimum boiling binary azeotropes. Using the residue curve map tool, two alternative designs, without a decanter (FS1) and with a decanter (FS2), are devised and optimized with respect to the dominant design variables. A high single-pass reactor conversion is necessary so that the reactor effluent composition is in the appropriate distillation region to guarantee feasibility of the separation scheme. Also, reactor oversizing is needed to ensure operability for a moderately large throughput increase. FS2 is finally recommended as it consumes \u223c8% less energy than FS1 and its total annualized cost (TAC) is approximately the same as that of FS1 post reactor oversizing. Effective rejection of large throughput and feed composition changes using decentralized plantwide control is demonstrated for FS2. In particular, the organic layer material balance control on the decanter is shown to significantly affect the overall plantwide response time. The case study is a categorical pitch for simultaneous design and operability studies.",

Fear of physical scarcity can lead to pursuit of security through measures that undermine both security and economic well-being. A prominent example is national priority often given to economic self-sufficiency, especially in energy and food. In contrast, security and economic well-being are maximized by following three pillars of sustainable development: adopting a complex, dynamical systems approach to resource modeling; adhering to efficient paths of consumption and natural resource use, as prescribed by Frank Ramsey and Harold Hotelling as far back as 1928 and 1931, respectively; and fostering equity across generations and stewardship for the future by setting appropriate discount rates. In the Asia-Pacific region, enhanced international cooperation provides the foundation on which these three pillars rest.",

The resulting groundwater salinity has led to agricultural productivity decline and economic losses. This study developed a Central Planner Model (CPM) to identify the feasibility of salinity control and agricultural productivity improvements in the region. Comparison of the results of the CPM with the simulated outcomes under business-as-usual practices suggest that central planning and intervention can help reducing salinity, preserving profits, and conserving the agricultural area in the long run. The CPM results are expected to be used as the basis for developing intervention mechanism that promote changes in the current practices and help with sustainability of farming in the Batinah regions of Oman.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Renewable energy refers to sources of energy that are not finite, and therefore are theoretically constantly available. The chief sources include wind, sun, waves, geothermal energy (energy available from beneath the earth\u2019s surface), tidal power, as well as energy derived from plant and agricultural sources (biomass, biogas and biofuels). Furthermore, it is possible to extract landfill gases from waste disposal facilities. All these sources are at different levels of research, development and commercialisation. Solar energy can be derived from photovoltaic cells (e.g. on rooftops) or from concentrating solar collectors (towers collecting sun rays deflected off a series of mirrors or heliostats, some using molten salt for power storage). This chapter will try and investigate the reasons for this slow uptake in renewable energy. It starts with an analysis of the country\u2019s energy profile in order to inform the reader of current energy and electricity use (Sect. 2). Some time is then spent understanding the nature of South Africa\u2019s current electricity crisis, and the pressures on government and the utility to deliver much more supply (Sect. 3). Existing policy on renewable energy will next be examined (Sect. 4), followed by a brief discussion on climate policy and an attempt at integrated energy planning (Sect. 4). From all the foregoing, the conclusion sets out to return to our initial question and provide a more consolidated understanding of why the country\u2019s commitment to renewable energy remains limited.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "China\u2019s sheer size, vast population and competing development priorities (whose pathways often contribute to severe environmental degradation), as well as increasing economic disparity across regions, are among the many challenges facing China\u2019s current leaders. As documented in the previous chapters, climate change presents an additional stressor. China has been subject to floods, droughts and heat waves for millennia; these hazards are not new. What is new is how rapidly climate risks are changing for different groups of people and sectors. This is due to the unprecedented rates of change in multiple processes \u2013 socio-economic development, migration, land use change, pollution and urbanisation \u2013 occurring alongside increasingly more intense and frequent weather hazards and shifts in seasons. China\u2019s people and ecosystems are facing dynamic pressures that threaten the progress made in lifting large segments of the population out of poverty. It is within this challenging context that China\u2019s policy makers, businesses and citizens must manage climate risk and build resilience. China faces similar difficulties to other countries in grappling with climate risk and adaptation as a \u2018wicked challenge\u2019. As discussed in Chapter 1, developing climate risk management and adaptation strategies and polices is difficult for a number of reasons, including: Limited data records; low financial, computational and research capacity for conducting and understanding integrated risk assessments; over-reliance on technological and engineering solutions; and the necessity of cross-sector policies and actions that do not sit conveniently within any one government agency or research discipline. Adaptation planning for policy making requires significant investment of both human and financial resources, and many countries currently lack capacity in core areas needed for adaptation. Ensuring successful long-term adaptation is complex, as it involves trade-offs between certain actions. Even with the best data and intent, the results can lead to policies and actions that create maladaptive futures. The challenge for China, an emerging world power, is how to approach the risks and opportunities presented by climate change while also addressing long-term socio-economic needs \u2013 particularly the needs of diverse vulnerable populations \u2013 in more sustainable ways, despite an uncertain climate future. This closing chapter documents the evolution of Chinese climate adaptation planning efforts, from approaches in assessment research to institutional arrangements and policy. It does so by examining assessment research methodologies and attitudes toward the environment and natural resource use, both of which underpin current policy and planning decisions. The chapter provides an overview of key adaptation policies that China has instituted at national to provincial scales in light of research priorities and concerns, such as those documented in the other chapters. The chapter covers some of the ongoing challenges to national and provincial adaptation policy and planning. It also highlights, and concludes with, China\u2019s emerging South-South climate policy and cooperation efforts in moving forward with treating adaptation as an iterative, cooperative process.",

In order to achieve this goal, first, the composition study was conducted in Sakarya, Turkey for one year. The results of first step are to be utilized as a reliable data source in establishing a complete picture of the environmental performances of municipal solid waste management systems with a life cycle perspective. The functional unit of the study was selected as one ton of municipal solid waste generated in Sakarya. System boundaries included collection and transportation of municipal solid waste and its treatment and disposal by MRF, incineration, composting and landfilling methods. Data on the process was gathered from a field study conducted in Sakarya, and from SimaPro 8.0.2 literature and libraries. The data was evaluated with CML-IA methodology by the means of abiotic depletion, abiotic depletion (fossil fuels), acidification, global warming, ozone depletion, human toxicity, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity and photochemical oxidation. According to the results, while landfilling and incineration have been confirmed as the worst waste final disposal alternatives, composting and material recovery showed better performance. An integrated system (MRF, composting, incineration and landfilling) is considered as a solution towards improved sustainability to overcome the existing waste management problem. The paper showed LCA to be a valuable tool which can help governors and managers plan an integrated waste management strategy that provides more preferable environmental outcomes than the strategy suggested.",

Six parameters listed in DOE-WQI were measured based on standard methods: pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS) and ammonical nitrogen (AN). The results indicated the impact of various anthropogenic activities which contribute to high values of BOD, COD, TSS and AN at middle and downstream stations, as compared with the upstream of the basin. The reverses were true for the pH and DO values. The DOE-WQI ranged from 71.5-94.6% (mean 86.9%), which corresponded to a classification status range from slightly polluted to clean. With respect to the Malaysia National Water Quality Standards (NWQS), the level of most of the parameters measured remained at Class I which is suitable for the sustainable conservation of the natural environment, for water supply without treatment and as well as for very sensitive aquatic species.

    "abstract_cleaned": "1 Introduction Marine environments provide significant benefits to man, for example through the provision of seafood and other resources worth trillions of dollars per annum, regulation of the Earth's climate, and the modulation of global biogeochemical cycles (Holmlund and Hammer, 1999), water quality maintenance (Worm et al., 2006), and also cultural and aesthetic benefits (Lewis, 2012). In spite of its clear importance, the marine environment is subject to huge pressure from anthropogenic sources. These pressures arise from inter alia the overexploitation of marine species, nutrient loading from land-based agriculture, underwater noise, the introduction of invasive species, and increasing oceanic acidification and habitat degradation. The threats are frequently interlinked. Further, in terms of biodiversity loss, Lotze et al. (2006) estimate that the human exploitation of marine species is responsible for 96% of species extinctions. The ecosystem based approach (EBA) is a managed response to these anthropogenic impacts on marine ecosystems. The aim of the EBA is to facilitate the protection, recovery, and sustainable use of marine ecosystems, applying a multisector approach. Any management approach is likely to entail trade-offs, in the sense that there are some stakeholders who will realize net benefits from the management intervention and others that will incur net losses. There are winners and losers even within a body of stakeholders (e.g. fishermen). Further, one significant broad stakeholder group is \u2018wider society\u2019, and it is important to capture broader social welfare changes arising from any management intervention. There is considerable variability in the extent to which the benefits and costs arising from applying the EBA are measurable, and also the extent to which they can be valued in monetary terms. For instance, changes in fish stocks have a relatively direct market value, whereas other benefits (such as a feeling of wellbeing arising from the aesthetics of the marine landscape) are much less tangible.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The availability of in situ spectrophotometers, such as the S::CAN spectro::lyser, has expanded the possibilities for highfrequency water quality data collection. However, biological and chemical fouling can degrade the performance of in situ spectrophotometers, especially in saline environments with rapid flow rates. A complex freshwater washing system has been previously designed to reduce chemical fouling for the S::CAN spectro::lyser spectrophotometer. In the current study, we present a simpler, cheaper alternative: the attachment of a sacrificial zinc anode. Results are presented detailing the S::CAN spectro::lyser performance with and without the addition of the sacrificial anode. Attachment of the zinc anode provided efficient corrosion protection during 2-wk deployments in a highly dynamic (average tidal range, 2.5 m) saline tidal saltmarsh creek at Groves Creek, Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, Savannah, GA.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Methods using extensive field data and three-season Landsat TM and PALSAR imagery were developed to map wetland type and identify potential wetland stressors (i.e., adjacent land use) for the United States and Canadian Laurentian coastal Great Lakes. The mapped area included the coastline to 10 km inland to capture the region hydrologically connected to the Great Lakes. Maps were developed in cooperation with the overarching Great Lakes Consortium plan to provide a comprehensive regional baseline map suitable for coastal wetland assessment and management by agencies at the local, tribal, state, and federal levels. The goal was to provide not only land use and land cover (LULC) baseline data at moderate spatial resolution (20-30 m), but a repeatable methodology to monitor change into the future. The prime focus was on mapping wetland ecosystem types, such as emergent wetland and forested wetland, as well as to delineate wetland monocultures (Typha, Phragmites, Schoenoplectus) and differentiate peatlands (fens and bogs) from other wetland types. The overall accuracy for the coastal Great Lakes map of all five lake basins was 94%, with a range of 86% to 96% by individual lake basin (Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie and Superior).",

The catches of a fishery resource was used to evaluate the proposal, this is due to the great importance of this resource in the economy of a country, and its high variability presents difficulties in the forecasting; the catches of hakes from January 1963 to December 2008 along the Chilean coast (30\u00b0 S\u201340\u00b0S) are the application data. The forecasting strategy is presented in two stages: preprocessing and prediction. In the first stage the Singular Value Decomposition of a circulant matriz (CSVD) resultant of the mapping time series is applied to extract the components, after the decomposition and grouping, the components interannual and annual were obtained. In the second stage a conventional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is implemented to predict the extracted components. The results evaluation shows a high prediction accuracy through the strategy based on the combination CSVD-ANN. Besides, the results were compared with the conventional nonlinear prediction based on an Autoregressive Neural Network. The improvement in the prediction accuracy by using the proposed decomposition strategy was demonstrated.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata) (SRO) is an oyster species that only occurs in estuaries along Australia's east coast. The SRO industry evolved from commercial gathering of oyster in the 1790s to a high production volume aquaculture industry in the 1970s. However, since the late 1970s the SRO industry has experienced a significant and continuous decline in production quantities and the industry's future commercial viably appears to be uncertain. The aim of this study was to review the history and the status of the SRO industry and to discuss the potential future prospects of this industry. This study summarised findings of the existing literature about the industry and defined development stages of the industry. Particular focus was put on the more recent development within the industry (1980s-present) which has not been covered adequately in the existing literature. The finding from this study revealed that major issues of the industry are linked to the management of prevailing diseases, the handling of water quality impairments from increasing coastal development, increasing competition from Australia's Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) industry and the current socio-economic profile of the industry. The study also found that policy makers are currently confronted by the dilemma of saving a dying art. Findings from this industry review may be vital for current and future fisheries managers and stakeholders as a basis for reviewing industry management and development strategies. This review may also be of interest for other aquaculture industries and fisheries who are dealing with similar challenges as the SRO industry.",

Some general information for about political structure and the lack of support mechanism of Turkey are given. For that purpose, a comparison between some developed countries and Turkey is included in this article. Turkey is a country which has wind energy potential on land and sea more than many European countries but the value of installed wind power plants is less than these countries. There is no power generation from offshore wind turbines in Turkey whereas it is surrounded on three sides by seas. The 2023 target which is about the renewable energy generation of Turkey is the 30%. Many developed countries identify long-term plans and implement the policies depend on these plans to exploit wind energy potential more efficiently. In this study, literature screening is adopted. According to findings obtained from the comparison between developed countries and Turkey, it is concluded that although Turkey has a higher potential then a lot of developed countries regarding wind energy, expected efficiency cannot be obtained due to the lack of a national renewable energy policy and the fact that wind energy is not promoted by incentives. Energy planning and management are necessary to promote wind energy which has a vital importance for the development and future of Turkey.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The idea of sustainable production and consumption is becoming a widely-accepted societal goal worldwide. However, its implementation is slow and the world continues to speed down an unsustainable path. One of the difficulties is the sheer complexity of production systems that would need to be re-engineered in a more sustainable way as well as the number of sustainability constraints that have to be considered and satisfied simultaneously. This paper argues that bringing about sustainable production and consumption requires a systems approach underpinned by life cycle thinking as well as an integration of economic, environmental and social aspects. In an attempt to aid this process, a decision-support framework has been developed comprising a range of tools, including scenario analysis, life cycle assessment, life cycle costing, social sustainability assessment, system optimisation and multi-attribute analysis. An application of the framework is illustrated on a case study related to energy.",

Three phases of social problem construction are named: (i) Children in prison as a practical and private matter; (ii) intense debate, problem formulation and developing practices and (iii) a public institutionalised practice. The position of children changed from one of invisibility to the target of protection. On the basis of children's rights, children in prison became understood as a group of children who are in need of child protection services.

Part one highlights critical debates that have emerged within research on religions and development, particularly with respect to theoretical, conceptual and methodological considerations, from the perspective of development studies and its associated disciplines. Parts two to six look at different regional and national development contexts and the place of religion within these. These parts integrate and examine the critical debates raised in part one within empirical case studies from a range of religions and regions. Different religions are situated within actual locations and case studies thus allowing a detailed and contextual understanding of their relationships to development to emerge. Part seven examines the links between some important areas within development policy and practice where religion is now being considered, including: Faith-Based Organisations and Development, Public Health, Religion and Development, Human rights, Religion and Development Sustainable Development, Climate Change and Religion, Global Institutions and Religious Engagement in Development, Economic Development and Religion, Religion, Development and Fragile States, Development and Faith-Based Education. Taking a global approach, the Handbook covers Africa, Latin America, South Asia, East and South-East Asia, and the Middle East. It is essential reading for students and researchers in development studies and religious studies, and is highly relevant to those working in area studies, as well as a range of disciplines, from theology, anthropology and economics to geography, international relations, politics and sociology.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Index-based weather insurance is a major institutional innovation that could revolutionize access to formal insurance for millions of smallholder farmers and related individuals. It has been introduced in pilot or experimental form in many countries at the individual or institutional level. Significant efforts have been made in research to assess its impacts on shock coping and risk management, and to contribute to improvements in design and implementation. While impacts have typically been positive where uptake has occurred, uptake has generally been low and in most cases under conditions that were not sustainable. This paper addresses the reasons for this current discrepancy between promise and reality. We conclude on perspectives for improvements in product design, complementary interventions to boost uptake, and strategies for sustainable scaling up of uptake. Specific recommendations include: (1) The first-order importance of reducing basis risk, pursuing for this multiple technological, contractual, and institutional innovations. (2) The need to use risk layering, combining the use of insurance, credit, savings, and risk-reducing investments to optimally address different categories of risk. For this, these various financial products should be offered in a coordinated fashion. (3) Calling on a role for state intervention on two fronts. One is the implementation of public certification standards for maximum basis risk of insurance contracts; the other is smart subsidies for learning, data accumulation, initial re-insurance, and catastrophic risks. (4) Using twin-track institutionallevel index insurance contracts combined with intra-institution distribution of payouts to reduce basis risk and improve the quality of insurance. For this, credible intra-institutional rules for idiosyncratic transfers must be carefully designed. Finally (5), the need for further research on the determinants of behavior toward risk and insurance, the design of index-based insurance products combined with others risk handling financial instruments, and rigorous impact analyses of on-going programs and experiments.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Exponential population growth in a world with uneven freshwater distribution will sharply increase water demands. Rising global temperatures exacerbate violent storms and prolonged drought. Salinization occurs at coastal deltas from rising sea levels and in groundwater from overpumping. The World Bank estimates that 25-30% freshwater is wasted, costing the global economy $14. billion annually. This paper highlights recent technologies developed to augment finite freshwater systems and presents potential remediation to relieve agricultural stress. Improving water management in agriculture rests on implementing sustainable irrigation techniques, developing crop modifications that help tolerate water stress, and promoting cooperation among stakeholders. Innovative techniques permit desalination that is less energy intensive and preserves membranes. Recycling highly purified sewage water is a powerful tool for replenishing groundwater. Although growing crops for biofuels is incompatible with global demands for freshwater and food, recent studies on cellulosic biomass and microalgae cultivation hold promise as economically viable energy sources.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology combines the biological degradation process with micro- and ultrafiltration and is widely regarded as an effective tool for water treatment and water reuse owing to its high-quality water product and low footprint. MBR technology-treated water is of high clarity and is significantly reduced in germs so that it is ideally suited for being discharged to sensitive receiving waters such as natural reserve areas or for being reused in a variety of applications such as irrigation or industrial processes. Aerobic MBRs, which make use of the aerobic-activated sludge process, are widely used to treat municipal and industrial wastewater, and a variety of membranes are commercially available. Because of their robustness and flexibility, submerged MBR systems are increasingly preferable. Because of increasing water scarcity, the aerobic MBR market is witnessing strong growth worldwide, particularly in large-scale applications. In addition to aerobic MBRs, anaerobic MBRs (AnMBR) have become the focus of attention in research and development because these systems have the ability to provide biogas for energy production. Membrane fouling and water flux decline are the most important issues in MBR application. In general, membrane fouling problems are more pronounced in AnMBRs; this hampers the widespread application of full-scale reactors. In addition to the common pressure-driven MBRs, the combination of forward osmosis and biological degradation has aroused the interest of researchers in recent years owing to its superior water quality and the fact that no pump energy is needed to drive the membrane separation process. This chapter highlights the fundamentals of MBRs. In addition, areas of application, factors affecting the process, and case studies of aerobic and AnMBR processes for water treatment and reuse in the laundry and food industry are addressed. The case studies demonstrate the technical benefits of MBR technology but also show the economical viability of this technology.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Money has been with us since time immemorial. It serves many functions, underwriting exchange and transactions as well as the spatial and temporal integration of human activity. It comes in many forms and is more than a component part of market capitalism. Its modern form is represented by finance, the financial services industry, and what many commentators refer to as the financialization of economy and society. For many writers, modern finance is distinct and autonomous from industries that produce and trade in commodities. But there is little doubt that twenty-first-century globalization would not have been possible without the global financial services industry. Research on the topic is to be found across the social sciences, including accounting, economics, human geography, political science, and sociology. In this article, the geographical building blocks of the global financial services industry are identified, emphasizing the spatial structure of gross flows as well as the role and significance of financial centers. Understanding the geography of finance also requires an appreciation of the various scales, at which finance appears in everyday life. So, for example, the article also focuses upon the relevant literature in geography on financial literacy, financial exclusion, and financial crisis. The article opens and closes with reference to the global financial crisis and, most importantly, the Euro crisis. The Euro crisis has been accompanied by a landscape of despair that is likely to profoundly mark the prospects of whole regions and countries across Europe over the coming decades.",

Primary gaps in knowledge that hinder policy development for integrated management of water\u2013bioenergy systems are highlighted. Four case studies in the Americas are analyzed to illustrate relevant spatial and temporal scales for impact assessment, along with unique aspects of biofuel production compared to other agroforestry systems, such as energy-related conflicts and tradeoffs. Based on the case studies, the potential benefits of integrated resource management are assessed, as is the need for further case-specific research.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Climate change is expected to place biological diversity under increasing stress and threaten several species with extinction. To combat the threats caused by a changing climate, several policy documents and items of literature on conservation biology have proposed a number of proactive measures to help species and habitats to adapt to climate change. This article presents the results of an analysis of the capacity of the Finnish regulatory system to provide an effective framework for the measures proposed and the capacity of the regulatory system to enhance adaptive management, which is considered important in the era of climate change. The analysis reveals several weaknesses in the Finnish regulatory system. Legislative changes are likely to be needed to harness the existing conservation tools to support climate change adaptation measures.",

Both have recently been subject to patient pressure, favouring domestic and not cross-border services. The oppressive effect of regulation has been best illustrated in Italy, where legislation introduced as Law 40 in 2004 imposed restrictions on embryo freezing and embryo selection. After a decade of legal challenges by patients, the components of Law 40 have now been deemed unconstitutional in Italy. Similarly, a paucity of donor gametes in the UK has left many patients with few options but to seek donors and treatments overseas. Yet new techniques of donor recruitment and a revised allowance of compensation now means that some UK clinics can meet all requirements for donor gametes and patient matching from their own resources.",

    "title": "An in-depth view of climate change: Addressing climate change while making a transition on the development mode",
    "abstract_cleaned": "While fossil fuels greatly contribute to human society, they pose great challenges to natural resources, the environment, and climate change. Developed countries, like the United States, formulated strategic measures to ensure their sustainable development and leading positions in the world. These measures include new green policies, development of shale gas, revitalization of nuclear power, energy independence, reindustrialization, and new low-carbon development based on a combination of Internet technology and renewable energy. Developing countries are also trying to introduce balanced strategies of poverty alleviation and sustainable development. Globally, industrial civilization is being transformed to ecological civilization and green, low-carbon development is a global trend. Addressing climate change provides new strategic factors to further this development. China should take substantial actions to realize sustainable development in a new road: China is in the critical stage of changing its development mode, so it is vital to choose an appropriate development path. This extensive development comes at the high price of consuming too much resources and scarring the environment. Mitigation and adaptation strategies for addressing climate change can help the transition of development. Based on the analysis of the development data of developed countries, the author introduces the concept of \u201ctwo-type developed countries\u201d with an understanding that not all developed countries must take the same development mode. He also holds the view that China should achieve modernization in a more energy-saving and more carbon-efficient manner compared with that of two-type developed countries. An analysis of \u201ctwo competitions\u201d that China is facing shows that changing the developing mode is urgent and China should grasp this opportunity in the next five to ten years, which is a key period for this transition. This paper discusses the low-carbon development goals and the three-step process. Low-carbon development does not necessarily restrict economic development. It, however, can expedite the transition of the development mode and this is a low-carbon and green development path. Transition of the development mode includes implementation of China\u2019s green and low-carbon energy strategies, low-carbon society construction, development of agriculture and forestry, garbage sorting and utilization, innovation of urbanization, etc. Improvement of national infrastructure construction includes water safety, environment and climate monitoring system, intelligent energy web, basic database, etc. Addressing climate change can significantly improve the nation\u2019s basic research level. In summary, it mitigates backward production capability, extensive development, and environmental damage while promoting technological advancement, scientific development, and ecological civilization.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Metal pollution, due to various anthropogenic sources, may pose a threat to marine ecosystems. Metals can be introduced into food chains via bioaccumulation in primary producers, and may potentially lead to toxic effects. Macroalgae are used as food by a wide variety of organisms, and are therefore extremely important in aquatic systems. This study investigated the accumulation and effects of metals in two macroalgae species. The green seaweed, Ulva lactuca and the red seaweed, Agardhiella subulata were each concurrently exposed to five metals (Cu, Ni, Pb, Cd, and Zn) and U. lactuca was also exposed to each metal individually for 48 h. Metal accumulation in the seaweed was measured, and various photosynthetic parameters were assessed, using imaging pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry. Increased metal accumulation occurred in both seaweed species after 48 h exposure to metal mixtures and each metal individually. The distribution of metals in both seaweed species changed with increasing metal exposure concentrations, resulting in higher proportions of Cu and Zn in the metal-exposed groups, as compared to respective controls. Further, U. lactuca accumulated higher concentrations of metals when exposed to each metal individually rather than in metal mixtures, suggesting interactions among metals for uptake and/or bioaccumulation. Significant impairment of photosynthetic parameters in U. lactuca was observed after exposure to 100 and 1000 \u03bcg/L metal mixtures, as well as 100 \u03bcg/L of either Cd or Cu. These results demonstrate metal bioaccumulation and toxic effects in important primary producers, and may have implications for higher trophic levels.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The management of marine resources is a politically and culturally driven process, shaped by human livelihoods and perceptions, where notions of both space and place shape policies and decision-making in fundamental ways. An emerging sub-field within geography critically explores geographic aspects of marine resource management. However, there has been little work to fully articulate this field and to describe the contributions of geographic methodologies and lenses to understanding marine resource management processes. This special issue provides one of the first collections of geographic papers focused on the socio-cultural and socio-spatial dimensions of marine resource management, emphasizing research that has or can be applied to management and policy discussions. The papers in this issue cover critical topics within this emerging field, examining the combined influences of social, ecological, cultural, political, economic, historical, and geographic factors on how marine spaces and resources are used, perceived, and managed. Important themes include: emerging spatial approaches to marine resource management, human dimensions of marine protected areas, the roles of mapping and GIS, the integration of quantitative and qualitative data, and the varying ways in which marine spaces and places are conceptualized by marine resource users and managers. Issues of marine resource governance, community engagement, and vulnerability also play key roles in the future of marine resource management. The papers in this issue shed light on space, place, and human-environment interactions in coastal marine systems, making it clear that questions about stakeholder inclusion and representation, particularly in spatial forms, will continue to dominate the field for some time to come. Future research in this field will be fruitfully informed by core geographical heuristics of space, place, and human-environment dynamics.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Municipal sludge from primary settling tanks of the Sewage treatment plant (STP) is a potentially important bio mass for the production of bio gas. Large amount of sludge is daily produced at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) where anaerobic digesters are located. Coupling the waste water treatment plant with the micro-algal culture is currently considered one of the most promising avenues towards the production of renewable bioenergy, either in the form of biodiesel or biogas. Research on anaerobic digestion of microalgae and sewage sludge will be important for the future of WWTPs because it could be a key step for recycling nutrients for algal cultivation as well as for energy recovery. Any co-substrate can have a co-effect in the sense that they stimulate enzymatic synthesis that can also improve the anaerobic digestion yield. Studies have shown that co-digestion can increase the anaerobic digestibility of algae by improving the substrate composition. Early studies have shown that due to the difference in anaerobic inocula, waste composition, and the experimental environment the quantity and the quality of the methane production vary widely. Sewage Sludge improves the digestibility of microalgae and enhances the production of methane. Co-digestion of waste paper and algal sludge could efficiently balance the feed stock Carbon-Nitrogen(C/N) ratio between 20-25 likely to benefit the methane production rate. This paper reviews recent experimental findings of the co digestion of algae with sewage and several substrates and the methods to enhance the methane production and the factors affecting the augmentation of the bio gas.",

Methods This study used nationwide oral health survey data from Australia (n = 1200 in 1999; n = 2729 in 2005), Brazil (n = 13 431 in 2003; n = 9779 in 2010) and USA (n = 2542 in 1999; n = 1596 in 2005). Absolute income inequalities were calculated using Absolute Concentration Index (ACI) and Slope Index of Inequality (SII), while relative inequalities were calculated using Relative Concentration Index (RCI) and Relative Index of Inequality (RII). Results Prevalence of ID in the studied period dropped from 8.7% to 3.1% in Australia; from 42.1% to 22.4% in Brazil; and remained stable in USA, nearly 8.0%. Absolute income inequalities were highest in Brazil, followed by the USA and Australia; relative inequalities were lower in Brazil than in Australia and the USA. ID was higher among Brazilian females (2010) and for the poorest group in all countries and periods. A remarkable reduction in absolute inequalities were found in Australia [Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and AIC 60%] and in Brazil (SII 25%; ACI 33%) while relative inequalities increased both in Australia (RCI and RII 40%) and in Brazil (RCI 24%; RII 38%). No changes in absolute and relative income inequalities were found in the USA. Conclusion There were still persistent absolute and relative income inequalities in ID in all examined countries. There has been a reduction in absolute income inequalities in ID but an increase in relative income inequalities.",

Households in the study area were net purchasers of food, as is the situation in most rural households of South Africa. High levels of unemployment (97.5 %) among household heads were observed in the study areas. In times of food shortages, most households relied on borrowing from shops against future payment. Most of the food insecurity coping strategies used by the households had long-term detrimental effects. The ultimate way to improve the food security in rural South Africa is to increase per capita incomes and/or ensure that households have the resources and capacity to produce their own food through farming.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Despite overall increased production in the last century, it is critical that grazing production systems focus on improving beef and dairy efficiency to meet current and future global food demands. For livestock producers, production efficiency is essential to maintain long-term profitability and sustainability. This continued viability of production systems using pasture- and range-based grazing systems requires more rapid adoption of innovative management practices and selection tools that increase profitability by optimizing grazing management and increasing reproductive performance. Understanding the genetic variation in cow herds will provide the ability to select cows that require less energy for maintenance, which can potentially reduce total energy utilization or energy required for production, consequently improving production efficiency and profitability. In the United States, pasture- and range-based grazing systems vary tremendously across various unique environments that differ in climate, topography, and forage production. This variation in environmental conditions contributes to the challenges of developing or targeting specific genetic components and grazing systems that lead to increased production efficiency. However, across these various environments and grazing management systems, grazable forage remains the least expensive nutrient source to maintain productivity of the cow herd. Beef and dairy cattle can capitalize on their ability to utilize these feed resources that are not usable for other production industries. Therefore, lower-cost alternatives to feeding harvested and stored feedstuffs have the opportunity to provide to livestock producers a sustainable and efficient forage production system. However, increasing production efficiency within a given production environment would vary according to genetic potential (i.e., growth and milk potential), how that genetic potential fits the respective production environment, and how the grazing management fits within those genetic parameters. Therefore, matching cow type or genetic potential to the production environment is and will be more important as cost of production increases.",

The authors provide a cross-disciplinary approach including geopolitical, institutional, technological, corporate and environmental perspectives to analyse the underlying factors that shape the future development of the region. Three future scenarios are developed, exploring various levels of cooperation and development influenced by and resulting from potential political, commercial and environmental circumstances. Through these scenarios, the book improves understanding of the challenges and opportunities for Arctic petroleum resource development and promotes further consideration of the possible outcomes of future cooperation. The book should be of interest to students, scholars and policy-makers working in the areas of Arctic studies, oil and gas studies, energy security, global environmental governance, environmental politics and environmental technology.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Over the last decade, several countries around the world developed a collective sense of doom and gloom: Their Zeitgeist could be characterized as one of decline. Paradoxically, in some countries, such as the Netherlands, this collective discontent with society seems to exist despite high levels of individual well-being. Current psychological research informs us about why individuals would feel unduly optimistic, but does not account for a collective sense of decline. The present research develops a novel operationalization of Zeitgeist, referred to as a general factor Z. We conceptualize Zeitgeist as a collective global-level evaluation of the state (and future) of society. Three studies confirm that perceptions of the same societal problems at the personal and collective level differed strongly. Across these studies we found support for a hypothesized latent factor Z, underlying collective-level perceptions of society. This Z-factor predicted people's interpretation of new information about society that was presented through news stories. These results provide a first step in operationalizing and (ultimately) understanding the concept of Zeitgeist: collectively shared ideas about society. Implications for policy are discussed.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Seabirds are often proposed as useful indicators of marine ecosystems because of their typically tight response to varying levels of prey abundance. We demonstrate here how this relationship can be modified for Southern Ocean higher-order predators when prey accessibility changes as a consequence of the temporally varying sea-ice environment. We examined within- and between-year fluctuations in breeding success, foraging trip duration, meal mass and fledgling weights of Ad\u00e9lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) at B\u00e9chervaise Island (67\u00b035\u2032S, 62\u00b049\u2032E) in east Antarctica to determine the degree of concordance between parameters over a 12-year period and how these varied in relation to sea-ice conditions. The penguins responded to extensive sea-ice (predominantly fast-ice) adjacent to their breeding colony by lengthening their foraging trips, and these years typically had reduced breeding success. Some years indicated good conditions for the penguins across parameters and had relatively high breeding success with heavier fledglings, while others indicated difficult conditions with poorer breeding success and lighter fledglings. In other years, there was discordance in the patterns of breeding success, fledgling mass and early versus late stage foraging trip durations, suggestive of different thresholds for different parameters or within-year changes in resource availability. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for the temporal variability in prey availability as a function of both accessibility and abundance when interpreting predator response curves.",

We accessed baseline data between 2004 and 2014 from 2,838 adults recruited to our Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC); a two-stage randomly selected 'Framingham-like' cohort of Mexican Americans on the US Mexico border with severe health disparities. We examined prevalence, risk factors and metabolic health in diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes. Two thirds of this Mexican American population has diabetes or pre-diabetes. Diabetes prevalence was 28.0%, nearly half undiagnosed, and pre-diabetes 31.6%. Mean BMI among those with diabetes was 33.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> compared with 29.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for those without diabetes. Significant risk factors were low income and educational levels. Most with diabetes had increased waist/hip ratio. Lack of insurance and access to health services played a decisive role in failure to have diabetes diagnosed. Participants with undiagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes had similar measures of poor metabolic health similar but generally not as severe as those with diagnosed diabetes. More than 50% of a minority Mexican American population in South Texas has diabetes or pre-diabetes and is metabolically unhealthy. Only a third of diabetes cases were diagnosed.

    "abstract_cleaned": "We present and compare four types of the isostatic gravity disturbances compiled at sea level over the world oceans and marginal seas. These isostatic gravity disturbances are computed by applying the Airy\u2013 Heiskanen (AH), Pratt\u2013Hayford (PH) and Vening Meinesz\u2013Moritz (VMM) isostatic models. In addition, we compute the complete crust-stripped (CCS) isostatic gravity disturbances which are defined based on a principle of minimizing their spatial correlation with the Moho geometry. We demonstrate that each applied compensation scheme yields a distinctive spatial pattern in the resulting isostatic marine gravity field. The AH isostatic gravity disturbances provide the smoothest gravity field (by means of their standard deviation). The AH and VMM isostatic gravity disturbances have very similar spatial patterns due to the fact that the same isostatic principle is applied in both these definitions expect for assuming a local (in the former) instead of a global (in the latter) compensation mechanism. The PH isostatic gravity disturbances are highly spatially correlated with the ocean-floor relief. The CCS isostatic gravity disturbances reveal a signature of the ocean-floor spreading characterized by an increasing density of the oceanic lithosphere with age.",

Expected impacts on soil compartment include floodings, seawater intrusions and use of saltwater for irrigation, with unknown effects on soil ecosystems and their inhabitants. The present study aimed at evaluating the effects of salinisation on soil ecosystems due to sea level rise. The reproduction and mortality of three standard soil invertebrate species (Folsomia candida, Enchytraeus crypticus, Hypoaspis aculeifer) in standard artificial OECD soil spiked with serial dilutions of seawater/gradient of NaCl were evaluated according to standard guidelines. An increased sensitivity was observed in the following order: H. aculeifer E. crypticus F. candida consistent with the different exposure pathways: springtails and enchytraeids are exposed by ingestion and contact while mites are mainly exposed by ingestion due to a continuous and thick exoskeleton. Although small differences were observed in the calculated effect electrical conductivity values, seawater and NaCl induced the same overall effects (with a difference in the enchytraeid tests where a higher sensitivity was found in relation to NaCl). The adverse effects described in the present study are observed on soils not considered saline. Therefore, the actual limit to define saline soils (4000\u03bcScm-1) does not reflect the existing knowledge when considering soil fauna.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the most common malignancies in low- and medium-income countries and represents a disease of public health importance because of its poor prognosis and high mortality rate in these regions. The striking variation in the prevalence of EC among different ethnic groups suggests a significant contribution of population-specific environmental and dietary factors to susceptibility to the disease. Although individuals within a demarcated geographical area are exposed to the same environment and share similar dietary habits, not all of them will develop the disease; thus genetic susceptibility to environmental risk factors may play a key role in the development of EC. A wide range of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes are responsible for the metabolism of carcinogens introduced via the diet or inhaled from the environment. Such dietary or environmental carcinogens can bind to DNA, resulting in mutations that may lead to carcinogenesis. Genes involved in the biosynthesis of these enzymes are all subject to genetic polymorphisms that can lead to altered expression or activity of the encoded proteins. Genetic polymorphisms may, therefore, act as molecular biomarkers that can provide important predictive information about carcinogenesis. The aim of this review is to discuss our current knowledge on the genetic risk factors associated with the development of EC in different populations; it addresses mainly the topics of genetic polymorphisms, gene-environment interactions, and carcinogenesis. We have reviewed the published data on genetic polymorphisms of enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and discuss some of the potential gene-environment interactions underlying esophageal carcinogenesis. The main enzymes discussed in this review are the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), N-acetyltransferases (NATs), cytochrome P450s (CYPs), sulfotransferases (SULTs), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), and epoxide hydrolases (EHs), all of which have key roles in the detoxification of environmental and dietary carcinogens. Finally, we discuss recent advances in the study of genetic polymorphisms associated with EC risk, specifically with regard to genome-wide association studies, and examine possible challenges of case-control studies that need to be addressed to better understand the interaction between genetic and environmental factors in esophageal carcinogenesis.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Throughout the history of evolutionary process cooperation has played a significant role in species sociological development and social groups are more likely to be survived than individuals in apparently unfavorable conditions. We bring in the concept of cooperation and introduce a new parameter \u03b3 in the generalized theta-logistic equation to model non-monotonic behavior of per capita growth rate. This phenomenological modeling approach highlights the interplay of two opposing forces, namely, the positive effect of cooperation and the negative density dependence (competition). Sibly et al. (2005) found that, the density dependent population growth curve seems to be concave in most animal populations, and follows the theta-logistic equation. To explore this phenomenon further, we investigated 715 time series from global population dynamics database and identified 28 cases, where, incorporating intra-species cooperation as an allometric trait into the logistic improves the description of the population growth. Nonlinear regression and bootstrap resampling technique were used to estimate the model parameters during the fitting of real data and the mean square error was used to compare the fitting performance of theta-logistic model and the model with cooperation. This study may help to identify the presence of cooperation from species growth profile obtained from census data. The numerical estimate of cooperation parameter and its threshold value can be used as a potential tool to decide the optimal management action in species conservation. The stability and bifurcation analysis are used to choose the critical value of \u03b3 above which the risk of extinction is high. The illustration has been provided by means of simulation and real data.",

A series of panel econometric models were used taking the period 1995-2011 into consideration. The results indicated that CO2 emissions in China increased over time, and were characterized by noticeable regional discrepancies; in addition, CO2 emissions also exhibited properties of spatial dependence and convergence. Factors such as population scale, economic level and urbanization level exerted a positive influence on CO2 emissions. Conversely, energy intensity was identified as having a negative influence on CO2 emissions. In addition, the significance of the relationship between CO2 emissions and the four variables varied across the provinces based on their scale of economic development. Scenario simulations further showed that the scenario of middle economic growth, middle population increase, low urbanization growth, and high technology improvement (here referred to as Scenario BTU), constitutes the best development model for China to realize the future sustainable development. Based on these empirical findings, we also provide a number of policy recommendations with respect to the future mitigation of CO2 emissions.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The genetic variability of apple tree response to drought is scarcely known because characterization of response to water constraint is usually low-throughput, which limits the possibility to take this trait into account in breeding programmes. In this research phenotypic response of apple tree scion hybrids of a 'Starkrimson' \u00d7 'Granny Smith' adult population to soil drought was considered through the leaf temperature as a proxy for transpiration, each tree being grafted onto the same rootstock genotype. The experiment was located in an experimental orchard where trees were submitted to contrasting summer irrigation treatments. The use of airborne multispectral images (in reflective and thermal infrared spectral domains) was explored as a possible approach to evaluate the hybrids' behavior in orchard conditions. Emphasis was put on the leaf transpiration status which was approached by measuring foliage temperature in thermal infrared (TIR) and by calculation of the Water Deficit Index (WDI). Here we proposed to calculate the WDI at tree scale, to overcome limitations of TIR interpretation for non-covering vegetation by taking the crop cover fraction into account. This was performed through the calculation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Our results highlight capacity of thermal imaging for phenotyping water stress. Spatial resolution of TIR images needs to be improved in order to refine the phenotyping data and specific image treatment is required to extract relevant leaf thermal information which can allow for effective differentiation of hybrids' behavior in response to soil water constraint. Remote sensing thus appears promising for phenotyping varietal response of apple tree to soil drought at adult stage in field conditions.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Background Globally, female street-based sex workers are vulnerable to gender-based violence. Previous research has shown having a peer social network can reduce sex workers' risks of victimization. However, mechanisms of how social network impacts violence among female street-based sex workers are still far from clear. Methods Our study was based on data abstracted from a paper-and-pencil survey administered among 218 female street-based sex workers in Shanghai, China. We focused on selfreported client-initiated violence and intimate-partner violence in emotional, physical, and sexual forms. Social networks were characterized by the size and sources of financial and psychosocial support (e.g. family, friends, and peers). Multi-variable logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) of each type of violence exposure by social network structure after the adjustment of age, education, and years in Shanghai. Results The street-based female sex workers in our study were primarily rural-to-urban migrants (95.7%) with an average age of 41 years old. 24.3%and 62.8% of the sex workers reported intimate-partner violence and client-initiated violence respectively. Lack of financial support, as defined by having only one individual or none in her peer support system to help financially, was significantly associated with self-reported intimate-partner violence (AOR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.1-5.9). Respondents who reported client-initiated violence, by contrast, were more likely to report lacked psychosocial support from family (AOR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.0-4.6) and peers (AOR: 5.1, 95% CI: 2.2-11). Conclusion This study is one of the first to systematically analyze the associations between social network and gender-based violence among street-based female sex worker. We reported a high prevalence of both types of gender-based violence and their complex associations with family, friends, and peer support network. Policies with goals to reduce violence against women may apply these findings to leverage social network in the interventions against gender-based violence.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Even today the efficient treatment of industrial wastewaters is not evident. The effluents may contain large amounts of harmful organic compounds that are not easily removed with conventional methods. This study focuses on the photocatalytic treatment of four organic pollutants originated from different types of industry. The pollutants are diuron (herbicide), p-coumaric acid (agro-industrial wastewater), bisphenol A and phthalic anhydride (plasti-cizers), which all are widely used and cause significant health and environmental problems. To get deeper understanding, the photocatalytic degradation of the model molecules was studied both in synthetic solutions and in industrial wastewater matrix over TiO2 P25 in two different batch photoreactors under UV-A irradiation. The effects of catalyst loading, pH and initial concentration were studied. To gain understanding on the reactivity of molecules and costs of treatment, the kinetic modelling and energy modelling were compared and the specific applied energy (ESAE) was estimated. ESAE is proposed as a useful value to estimate the energy needed to degrade one mole of pollutant and further to calculate the operating costs to treat the wastewater. Of the model pollutants, diuron was removed the most efficiently and its removal consumed the least amount of energy in terms of the specific applied energy. Bisphenol A was found to be the most difficult to be removed by photocatalysis. The industrial wastewater matrix affected negatively the removal results.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Purpose: Integrated agriculture and aquaculture (IAA), as typified by the mulberry dike-pond system (DPS) of the Pearl River delta of southern China, is often cited as an example of sustainable intensified production due to its characteristic closed loop recycling of nutrients. In this study, we tackle two issues that have been hardly addressed in previous analyses of aquaculture production, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe) from the pond and the role of labour. Methods: Previous assessments led us to revisit the sustainability of the DPS system as a model for a well-studied IAA system using a life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Our study quantifies on-farm CH4 and N2O emissions and indirect emissions embedded in inputs, using the global warming potential (GWP) metric. To model the indirect impact of the high labour requirements of the system, a simple methodology based on metabolizable energy requirements is proposed. Results and discussion: Our GHGe assessment suggests that using fish ponds to treat organic waste results in higher net emissions than alternative waste processing options (e.g. composting), even when the co-production of fish is accounted for. The majority of total system GWP100 (97 %) can be attributed to methane from the fertilised ponds. Food required to meet labour requirements plays an important role, from 11 to 22 % of total environmental impact. Conclusions: Methane from semi-intensive ponds fertilised with organic waste appears to be a significant source of GWP, calling into question the environmental sustainability of IAA systems such as the mulberry DPS. Improving sustainability in such systems will require better understanding of GHGe from waste-fed aquaculture ponds, notably with respect to on-farm N2O and CH4.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "As renewable electricity generation capacity increases, energy storage will be required at larger scales. Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) at large scales, with effective management of heat, is recognised to have potential to provide affordable grid-scale energy storage. Where suitable geologies are unavailable, compressed air could be stored in pressurised steel tanks above ground, but this would incur significant storage costs. Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), on the other hand, does not need a pressurised storage vessel, can be located almost anywhere, has a relatively large volumetric exergy density at ambient pressure, and has relatively low marginal cost of energy storage capacity even at modest scales. However, it has lower roundtrip efficiency than compressed air energy storage technologies. This paper carries out thermodynamic analyses for an energy storage installation comprising a compressed air component supplemented with a liquid air store, and additional machinery to transform between gaseous air at ambient temperature and high pressure, and liquid air at ambient pressure. A roundtrip efficiency of 42% is obtained for the conversion of compressed air at 50. bar to liquid air, and back. The proposed system is more economical than pure LAES and more economical than a pure CAES installation if the storage duration is sufficiently long and if the high-pressure air store cannot exploit some large-scale geological feature.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Today wood and nonwood forest resources management meets and often clashes with environment and biological diversity protection. A main problem is to understand relationships between the different roles of forest biodiversity, site, and management parameters. A multivariate statistical analysis has been carried out in order to interpret relationships between some forest biodiversity components and forest inventory data. Several indices of floristic diversity, species abundance, and structural heterogeneity at stand level have been calculated. The different components of forest biodiversity were separated by principal components analysis. Relations between forest biodiversity indices and site and management attributes have been investigated by two multivariate statistical techniques: bivariate correlation analysis and multiple linear regression. Results showed a high correlation between all the investigated components of forest biodiversity and some topographic and/or forest management attributes. Results also gave ancillary information to define sustainable forest management criteria.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Citizen science projects can gather datasets with observation counts and spatiotemporal coverage far in excess of what can easily be achieved using only professional scientists. However, there exists a potential trade-off between the number of participants and the quality of data gathered. The Bugs Count citizen science project had thousands of participants because of its few barriers to taking part, allowing participation by anyone in England with access to any area of outdoor space. It was designed to scope for both the effects of variation in local habitat and urbanisation on broad taxonomic groups of invertebrates, and the responses of six target \u2018Species Quest\u2019 species (Adalia bipunctata, Ocypus olens, Aglais urticae, Palomena prasina, Limax maximus, and Bombus hypnorum) to urbanisation. Participants were asked to search for invertebrates in three areas: \u2018soft ground surfaces\u2019, \u2018human-made hard surfaces\u2019, and \u2018plants\u2019 for 15 min per search. Participants recorded counts of taxa found and a range of environmental information about the survey area. Data samples were weighted according to identification experience and participant age and analysed using canonical correspondence analysis, and tests of observation homogeneity. Species Quest species showed species-specific relationships with urbanisation, but broad taxonomic groups did not show significant relationships with urbanisation. The latter were instead influenced by habitat type and microhabitat availability. The approach used demonstrates that citizen science projects with few barriers to entry can gather viable datasets for scoping broad trends, providing that the projects are carefully designed and analysed to ensure data quality.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The development of two Arctic Trough Mouth Fans (TMFs), the Storfjorden and Kveithola TMFs, is investigated by means of sub-bottom and seismic reflection profiles, multibeam bathymetry and sediment samples allowing their detailed stratigraphic architecture to be defined. We find that the TMFs mainly consist of an alternation of rapidly deposited glacigenic debris flows during glacial maxima and a sequence of well-layered plumites and hemipelagic sediments, which were mainly deposited during the deglaciation phase of the adjacent glacial trough. We have identified eight units above regional reflector R1, which indicate that the ice sheet reached the shelf edge within the Storfjorden Trough on at least three occasions during the last ~200 ka. A shallow subsurface unit of glacigenic debris flows suggests that the ice sheet had a short re-advance over the northern and central part of Storfjorden after the Last Glacial Maximum. From stratigraphy, core and literature data, we estimate that ice sheets reached the shelf edge between 19.5 to 22.5 ka, 61 to 65 ka and 135 to 167 ka. Detailed seismic imaging allows us to refine the sedimentary model of Arctic TMFs. The main differences to previous models involve gully formation during not only the deglaciation phase, but also during interglacials by dense shelf water cascading, and a specific timing for the occurrence of slope failures (i.e., shortly after the deglaciation phase). High mean sedimentation rates during glacial maxima of up to 18 kg m-2 yr-1 likely allow excess pore pressure to develop in the water rich plumites and hemipelagic sediments deposited in the previous deglacial period, particularly where such plumites attain a significant thickness. The position of the submarine landslides in the stratigraphic record suggest that such excess pore pressure is not enough to trigger the slope failures and suggests that earthquakes related to isostatic rebound are likely involved in the final activation.",

Presence-absence data are extremely rare in western China, and possible existence of remnant populations of dholes is not clear. Here, we document new records of dhole in a protected area in an arid region of the Altun Mountains in Xinjiang Autonomous Region in western China. From a total of 4517 camera-trap days at ten water sites between 2011 and 2013, we obtained seven independent records of dhole at three sites. Additionally, another reserve in Gansu Province which is located near Altun Mountains also recorded the species through camera-trap surveys. Our results indicate that dhole populations exist in the vast arid region of the Altun Mountains, and the current distribution of the dhole might be widespread in western China. We suggest that conservation efforts in this region should focus on minimizing the persecution and poaching of both dholes and their prey.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Due to the lack of other treatment options, patient candidates for participation in phase I clinical trials are considered the most vulnerable, and many ethical concerns have emerged regarding the informed consent process used in the experimental design of such trials. Starting with these considerations, this nonsystematic review is aimed at analyzing the decision-making processes underlying patients' decision about whether to participate (or not) in phase I trials in order to clarify the cognitive and emotional aspects most strongly implicated in this decision. Considering that there is no uniform decision calculus and that many different variables other than the patient-physician relationship (including demographic, clinical, and personal characteristics) may influence patients' preferences for and processing of information, we conclude that patients' informed decision-making can be facilitated by creating a rigorously developed, calibrated, and validated computer tool modeled on each single patient's knowledge, values, and emotional and cognitive decisional skills. Such a tool will also help oncologists to provide tailored medical information that is useful to improve the shared decision-making process, thereby possibly increasing patient participation in clinical trials.",

The aim was to quantify uncertainties originating from climate model chains, downscaling weather generator choice, and impact model parameterization. We find that while estimated climate impacts on yields are subject to large uncertainties originating from both climate model chains and impact model approaches, estimates of changes in crop-specific climate limitations are less ambiguous. We conclude that by subtracting the layer of uncertainty related to the aggregation of different climate influences on yield estimates and by focusing on estimated changes in climate limitations, more decision-relevant information can be provided to support crop-specific adaptation planning.",

This study aimed to investigate help-seeking behaviours, barriers to care and self-efficacy for seeking mental health care among young adults with current depression and/or suicidality in a low-income setting. Methods: This cross-sectional study used two sub-populations: a sub-sample of those suffering from current depression and/or suicidality (n = 247) and another of those not suffering from these conditions and not suffering from any other mental condition investigated (n = 502). Help-seeking behaviours, barriers to care and self-efficacy for mental health care seeking were measured among those suffering from current depression and/or suicidality (n, %). Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for experiencing barriers to care. Self-efficacy for seeking mental health care was compared between men and women in the two sub-populations. Results: Of the 247 men and women with current depression and/or suicidality, 36.0 % sought help at a health care unit and 64.0 % from trusted people in the community. Only six people received help from a mental health professional. The identified barriers were mainly related to accessibility and acceptability of health services. For the population suffering from current depression and/or suicidality, the self-efficacy scale for seeking mental health care suggested a low confidence in accessing mental health care but a high confidence in respondents\u2019 ability to successfully communicate with health care staff and to cope with consequences of seeking care. Conclusion: The current study clearly highlights young adults\u2019 poor access to mental health care services. To reach universal health coverage, substantial resources need to be allocated to mental health, coupled with initiatives to improve mental health literacy in the general population.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Sports and events play an important role in local identity building and creating a sense of community that encourages participation and increases social capital. Rural communities are specific areas with special needs and can face challenges and restraints when it comes to event organisation. The purpose of this paper is to identify organisational challenges and analyse the potential to achieving long-term sustainable social and economic outcomes linked to small-scale sports events in rural communities. Organisational challenges of rural communities in terms of organising sport events are examined and discussed using the framework of event leveraging developed by O'Brien and Chalip. This methodology is applied and discussed to a case study focusing on small-scale winter sport events in rural Croatia. Semi-structured interviews with local organisers were conducted in order to collect data on the overall event organisation and management, local coordination, role of community stakeholders and challenges facing strategic planning, with the intent to identify objectives for future events. Results were discussed independently and in the context of the leverage framework, with reflection on its applicability to rural communities as the event organisers. Recommendations are provided based on critical insight from the literature and are oriented on how to streamline the process of organising, delivering and managing of events in remote rural communities. Finally, the idea of inter-community organisation is proposed to ensure long-term social and economic benefits and to address the existing issues of overlapping of stakeholder categories, mixed objectives, distrust among stakeholders and inefficiently used local resources.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "In wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs),some variables such as BOD5 and COD that are related to effluent quality,are difficult to measure directly online due to technical or economic limitations. To deal with this problem,a soft sensor that is based on a deep neural network with a named stacked autoencoder (SAE) is developed for WWTPs. Neural networks with deep structure are superior to shallow ones when facing complex problems in modern applications,which makes them suitable for wastewater treatment processes. However,deep structures are difficult to train when using traditional learning algorithms,and there are no general guidelines for identifying the proper network structure for a specific application. In the present work,a deep learning technique called the greedy layer-wise training algorithm is employed to train a deep neural network,and a genetic-algorithm strategy is developed for identifying the number of neurons in each hidden layer. In order to demonstrate its usefulness,the proposed soft sensor is tested through the test-bed Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1 (BSM1) with different weather conditions. The results indicate that the proposed soft sensor based on a deep-structure neural network can achieve better prediction and generalization performance in comparison with commonly used methodologies.",

In 1.0-L semi-continuous tests, mesophilic AD of cassava pulp inoculated with I3 was carried out at organic matter loading rates (OLRs) of 1.5 to 12.5 kg volatile solids (VS)/(m3 d), whereas 1.5 to 18.0 kgVS/(m3 d) was used for thermophilic AD. For batch operations, all sludge types could be used as the inoculum for the mesophilic AD of cassava pulp, whereas only I1 was used for thermophilic AD. The maximum specific methane yields were 0.333 and 0.395 m3/kgVSadded, respectively, for mesophilic and thermophilic batch digestion with I1. During semi-continuous AD of cassava pulp inoculated with I3, high specific methane yields of 0.334 to 0.336 m3/kgVSadded were obtained under both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions.

    "abstract_cleaned": "As water is essential for life, animals have adaptations that increase their ability to survive during periods of water shortage. Accessing water by digging is one behavioural adaptation to water shortage used by some African mammals. Digging might also provide access to higher quality water below ground when surface water quality is poor. We investigated the digging of waterholes by wildlife in the Ruaha National Park (NP), in central Tanzania, during three dry seasons (June to November from 2011 to 2013). We monitored surface water availability and water quality at 10 sites along the Great Ruaha River (GRR) and eight non-GRR sites. We used camera-traps and direct observations to determine when and where digging to access water occurred. Elephant (Loxodonta africana), plains zebra (Equus quagga), warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) and yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus) dug waterholes and a further four species drunk from these holes. Waterholes were dug later in the dry season along the GRR (October) than at other sites (July). The likelihood of digging and drinking from waterholes was lower along the GRR than at non-GRR sites and did not depend on the absence of surface water but increased when surface water stopped flowing. Digging of waterholes was also significantly more likely when the bacterial load in available surface water increased but was independent of salinity levels. Escherichia coli load, indicative of faecal contamination, significantly increased with total aerobic bacterial load. Our results suggest that digging is an adaptation to avoid the ingestion of poor quality surface water highly contaminated with faeces, and thereby possibly also potentially pathogenic microbes, in addition to providing access to water when surface water is absent. Our findings also highlight (1) the essential role of the GRR as the key water source for wildlife in the Ruaha NP during the dry season, and (2) that maintenance of water flow throughout the dry season is essential to prevent deterioration of water quality in the GRR.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Methodological aspects of scale-related impact assessment from changing land use/land cover (LULC) management and climate on river basin water resources and their management are discussed. Both control the interactive hydrological process dynamics that transfer precipitation input on the landscape to the different surface and subsurface water resources components and ultimately to river runoff draining the river basin. As the integrated water resources management (IWRM) concept does not sufficiently account for the landscape-related process dynamics associated with LULC management, it is enhanced to the integrated land and water resources management (ILWRM) approach. The latter requires, firstly, a consistent methodological concept and, secondly, a toolset for its implementation. The DPSIR (D = Drivers, P = Pressures, S = State, I = Impacts, R = Responses) approach is a suitable analysis concept in this regard and is enhanced by a Decision Information Knowledge System (DIKS). Both are implemented by means of the integrated land management system (ILMS) toolset developed at the University of Jena, Germany, and tested in numerous research projects in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and South America. The majority of river catchment studies focus on a particular scale. Upscaling and downscaling of the hydrological knowledge they generate requires the separation of the generic knowledge components from their modifying local specifications. The interdisciplinary ILWRM applications presented in this paper from two projects in South Africa and SE Asia address this challenge by applying a multi-scale nested catchment approach (NCA) and respective upscaling and downscaling techniques to regionalize hydrological knowledge between scales.",

The employment of foreigners in Poland is regulated in several acts. The most important ones, from the perspective of relevance to general employment policy and migration policy, are the Act on Foreigners and the Act on Promoting Employment and Labour Market Institutions. One important legislative initiative is the bill amending the Employment Act, covering also regulations on the employment of migrant workers. Consultations on the bill have already been held with the social partners and other stakeholders. Non-payment of wages, as well as other serious forms of breach of labour law, constitutes a misdemeanour under Polish law and the Labour Inspectorate imposes a fine. Trade unions in the host countries are thus the natural partners for trade unions in Poland, to initiate actions towards the migrant workforce.",

This paper aimed to build a mathematical model and a traffic flow simulation based on CA model to study the intrinsic reasons of the congestion dilemma in the city especially in the big city, and to explore the correlation between urban scale and congestion effect. Research results showed that, if the existing traffic density was constant and the destination was always random, the continuous expansion of the scale of the city would inevitably leaded to increased congestion. And finally getting the conclusion that the traffic congestion state was easier to accept in the city within 20km x 20km, and this study would provide reference for the government to formulate reasonable urban and transportation planning.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Copyright 2016, Society of Petroleum Engineers.Simple definition of Sustainability is something that improves the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of supporting eco-systems. GASCO placed sustainability as topmost agenda and keen in minimizing environmental footprint. While the buildings consume 48% of energy, it is a Corporate Social Responsibility to focus on Sustainable and Energy Efficient Buildings. This paper addresses GASCO's journey towards Sustainability, from drafting Guidelines for Green Buildings in GASCO to its implementation in many buildings and to win 1st LEED GOLD certification in an ADNOC project and subsequent ESTIDAMA Pearls certifications. In basic engineering stage, options for different LEED/ESTIDAMA ratings are studied and technocommercial comparison tables prepared to conduct life cycle cost (LCC) analysis to evaluate and compare various design options. Attention is given for choice of construction type, location/orientation, materials, daylight / sunlight use, water recycling, energy conservation / renewable energy, traffic management and all other LEED/ ESTIDAMA requirements for achieving appropriate rating. Energy model for the proposed building(s) using approved dynamic simulation modelling software is prepared to calculate the baseline energy consumption and savings. Results, Observations, Conclusions: In 2009 when the international building sustainability rating systems were in budding stage, GASCO studied the prevailing Green Building & Sustainable aspects and prepared a document Guidelines for Green Buildings in Gasco, tailored to suit buildings in an oil/ gas industry. This has won ADNOC HSE Award 2009 under Sustainability category and still forms the basis for building projects following Green aspects. The LEED - Gold Certified New Administration Building proved efficient with savings in 47% potable water and 60% irrigation water and 14% Energy. 61% certified wood used in the building helped against deforestation, 100% VOC-free materials improved indoor air quality and 21% materials manufactured within 500 miles helped reducing the cost of logistics. A study to convert an existing office building as Green Building indicated a savings of 26% water and 30% energy, promoted 81% recycling of general waste and reduced 362 tons of carbon-emission annually. A new management office building also obtained ESTIDAMA Pearl 2 rating. Many non-process buildings are in FEED/ EPC stages targeting the LEED/ ESTIDAMA Certifications. Energy and water are valuable resources in the desert climate of UAE, so having efficient buildings is another way to protect the ecology and reduce operational costs. Contrary to the popular notion, Green Buildings cost only about 2% more compared to conventional buildings. Unlike hotels or apartments, GASCO finds its way to spearhead its corporate message of Sustainability in constructing Green Buildings in an industrial environment. With about a dozen of projects/ buildings aimed for the Green Building Certification, GASCO is pioneering the task of protecting the environment for future generations.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Protected areas are becoming a major land use, approaching 15% of the Earth\u2019s terrestrial surface and a growing percentage of coastal waters. These sites are popular for visitors, but face many management challenges, including how to adapt to climate change. Often established for biodiversity conservation, scenic beauty, or tourism objectives, protected areas should become a major part of national strategies to address climate change and the disasters that may come in the form of extreme climatic events. Protected areas often contain the ecosystems that are the most effective in storing carbon and make major contributions to adapting to climate change. But these sites need to be managed more effectively, and linking them to the growing public concern about climate change could be one means of doing so. Management approaches that should be supported include establishing protected area complexes that expand their influence to a landscape scale, incorporating climate change issues into protected management at both site and system scales, identify the multiple ecosystem services that protected areas provide as a means of building broader support for them, and many others. Protected areas can also contribute to recovery from extreme hazard events, for example by working with local communities to restore natural vegetation. To date, protected areas have been largely ignored by the Clean Development Mechanism established by the Climate Change Convention. This should change, and protected areas should be recognized for the many contributions they make to climate change mitigation and adaptation, thereby contributing to reducing disaster risks. A relatively simple step would be to incorporate protected area agencies more actively in the preparation of the national reports called for by the Framework Convention on Climate Change. Protected areas should also become eligible for support under the REDD+ programme.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "In this paper, we investigated alginate microspheres as a low-cost adsorbent for strontium (Sr(II)) removal and recovery from seawater. Alginate microspheres have demonstrated a superior adsorption capacity for Sr(II) ions (\u2248110 mg/g). A Freundlich isotherm model fits well with the Sr(II) adsorption of an alginate microsphere. The mechanism of Sr(II) adsorption is inferred as an ion exchange reaction with Ca(II) ions. The effects of the solution pH and co-existing ions in seawater are also investigated. Except for a pH of 1-2, Sr(II) adsorption capacity is not affected by pH. However, increasing the seawater concentration of metal cations seriously decreases Sr(II) uptake. In particular, highly concentrated (15,000 mg/L) Na(I) ions significantly interfere with Sr(II) adsorption. Sr(II) desorption was performed using 0.1 M HCl and CaCl2. Both regenerants show an excellent desorption efficiency, but the FTIR spectrum reveals that the chemical structure of the microsphere is destroyed after repeated use of HCl. Conversely, CaCl2 successfully desorbed Sr(II) without damage, and the Sr(II) adsorption capacity does not decrease after three repeated uses. The alginate microsphere was also applied to the adsorption of Sr(II) in a real seawater medium. Because of inhibition by co-existing ions, the Sr(II) adsorption capacity was decreased and the adsorption rate was retarded compared with D.I. water. Although the Sr(II) adsorption capacity was decreased, the alginate microsphere still exhibited 17.8 mg/g of Sr(II) uptake in the seawater medium. Considering its excellent Sr(II) uptake in seawater and its reusability, an alginate microsphere is an appropriate cost-effective adsorbent for the removal and recovery of Sr(II) from seawater.",

    "title": "Cockle population dynamics: recruitment predicts adult biomass, not the inverse",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Bivalves are an essential component of marine ecosystems, playing an important role in community maintenance. The abundance of an exploited bivalve population depends on the balance between inputs (reproduction/recruitment and growth) and outputs (mortality and fishery removals). Reproduction and subsequent successful recruitment are crucial for population sustainability. In the present study, the reciprocal relationship between recruitment (operationally defined as retention on a 1-mm sieve) and adult stock size was studied using a 17-year database (1997\u20132014) on an unexploited Cerastoderma edule population in a national nature reserve in Arcachon Bay, France. Results showed that cockle recruitment in a temperate climate with mild winters is rather unrelated to temperature in the previous months, but depends on recruitment timing. When temperature reached 14 \u00b0C in May, stimulating early recruitment, recruit density was high (500\u20131000 ind m\u22122), and the resulting cohort had a relatively long lifespan (>1 year) with high associated secondary production. Conversely, when temperature reached 14 \u00b0C in June, recruitment occurred later (June), recruit density was lower (0\u2013500 ind m\u22122), and the cohort had a shorter lifespan (<4 months) with a consequent low secondary production. Adult spawner biomass was not positively correlated with recruitment, and the spawner biomass at the time of recruitment did not negatively affect recruitment. More than previous studies, the present study showed that factors driving cockle recruitment success are highly site-dependent, temperatures at the site being only one component.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Dynamic size spectrum models have been recognized as an effective way of describing how size-based interactions can give rise to the size structure of aquatic communities. They are intermediate-complexity ecological models that are solutions to partial differential equations driven by the size-dependent processes of predation, growth, mortality, and reproduction in a community of interacting species and sizes. To be useful for quantitative fisheries management these models need to be developed further in a formal statistical framework. Previous work has used time-averaged data to \u201ccalibrate\u201d the model using optimization methods with the disadvantage of losing detailed time-series information. Using a published multispecies size spectrum model parameterized for the North Sea comprising 12 interacting fish species and a background resource, we fit the model to time-series data using a Bayesian framework for the first time. We capture the 1967-2010 period using annual estimates of fishing mortality rates as input to the model and time series of fisheries landings data to fit the model to output. We estimate 38 key parameters representing the carrying capacity of each species and background resource, as well as initial inputs of the dynamical system and errors on the model output. We then forecast the model forward to evaluate how uncertainty propagates through to population-and community-level indicators under alternative management strategies.",

This region is very important for marine biodiversity and includes many protected areas. However, urbanization, tourism and economic development (aquaculture, fisheries, commercial ports and nuclear energy generation) are some of the impacts and drivers of species introduction. Our survey found 16 species, only one native, two introduced and eleven cryptogenic. Two species could not be identified precisely. The most species-rich marina had 11 species and the most polluted three marinas had only six species each. Comparisons with literature indicated that marinas in the IGB had fewer species and fewer introductions than marinas in the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o Channel (S\u00e3o Paulo), in the same biogeographic region. Future monitoring should consider complementary methods such as passive collectors deployed during summer time and RAS in at least two different times of the year.",

    "title": "Advances in population biology of Rosa rugosa",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Rosa rugosa is a shrub species native to eastern China, Japan, Korea and the Russian Far East. The species is a key component of sand plant communities in its native range and a globally important germplasm resource for ornamental rose breeding. After introduction into Europe as a hardy, resistant garden rose in the 18th century, R. rugosa escaped and invaded many countries around the North Sea and the Baltic Sea as well as sandy coasts of North America. However, wild R. rugosa populations in China have decreased continuously over the past three decades. Consequentially, the species is considered rare and endangered in China, and is listed in the China Plant Red Data Book. A large number of studies have focused on the expanding R. rugosa populations in northwestern Europe and the shrinking populations in China. To identify future research directions, a comprehensive overview of the literature is crucial to gain insight into linkages and gaps among different studies. In this review, we analyze previous studies on the population biology of R. rugosa to clarify the ecological characteristics and changes of its distribution range in China. In addition, we discuss the potential factors driving the decrease of the native populations in China. Overall, R. rugosa populations in China suffer from reduced reproduction, poor seed quality, eroded genetic diversity due to genetic drift, and strong pressures from habitat loss and anthropogenic disturbances. The fenced enclosure of protected areas that has preserved existing shrubs has also stimulated the facilitated succession of plant communities and overgrowth of some tall grass species. External habitat degradation and internal genetic erosion may be contributing to the population decrease in China. According to research on invasive R. rugosa populations in northwestern Europe, the species is disturbance-favored and has expanded very quickly in its invasive range. It frequently forms large, dense and continuous monodominant shrub zones that exclude native species and plant communities from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea dunes and sandy beaches. Most of the invasive populations exhibit increased seed reproduction, mixture of multiple varieties, release from herbivory and parasitism. We infer that the evolved high adaptation of R. rugosa to novel environments, resistance to pathogens in its introduced range, and inappropriate anthropogenic disturbances are the main factors driving its invasion success. After comparing differences between endangered and invasive populations of R. rugosa, we propose that future research should focus on the following aspects: (1) comparative research on quantitative dynamics and genetic structure of endangered and invasive R. rugosa populations; (2) dynamic monitoring of natural R. rugosa populations and individual shrubs in its native and invasive ranges; (3) examining the differences of functional genes and genomics among R. rugosa populations and individual shrubs, therefore to discover specific genes or genotypes related to population invasiveness and/or depression; and (4) designing control or conservation strategies based on population biology of R. rugosa. By focusing on population dynamics, ecological genomics and the driving forces behind the decrease and expansion of R. rugosa, future work may lead to the development of efficient population management approaches and provide new insights into the evolutionary adaptation of species with similar features.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Soil organic matter (SOM) is key to maintaining soil fertility, mitigating climate change, combatting land degradation, and conserving above- and below-ground biodiversity and associated soil processes and ecosystem services. In order to derive management options for maintaining these essential services provided by soils, policy makers depend on robust, predictive models identifying key drivers of SOM dynamics. Existing SOM models and suggested guidelines for future SOM modelling are defined mostly in terms of plant residue quality and input and microbial decomposition, overlooking the significant regulation provided by soil fauna. The fauna controls almost any aspect of organic matter turnover, foremost by regulating the activity and functional composition of soil microorganisms and their physical-chemical connectivity with soil organic matter. We demonstrate a very strong impact of soil animals on carbon turnover, increasing or decreasing it by several dozen percent, sometimes even turning C sinks into C sources or vice versa. This is demonstrated not only for earthworms and other larger invertebrates but also for smaller fauna such as Collembola. We suggest that inclusion of soil animal activities (plant residue consumption and bioturbation altering the formation, depth, hydraulic properties and physical heterogeneity of soils) can fundamentally affect the predictive outcome of SOM models. Understanding direct and indirect impacts of soil fauna on nutrient availability, carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions and plant growth is key to the understanding of SOM dynamics in the context of global carbon cycling models. We argue that explicit consideration of soil fauna is essential to make realistic modelling predictions on SOM dynamics and to detect expected non-linear responses of SOM dynamics to global change. We present a decision framework, to be further developed through the activities of KEYSOM, a European COST Action, for when mechanistic SOM models include soil fauna. The research activities of KEYSOM, such as field experiments and literature reviews, together with dialogue between empiricists and modellers, will inform how this is to be done.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "In recent years, scholars adopting institutional theory have explained the tendency of entrepreneurs to operate in the informal sector to be a result of the asymmetry between formal institutions (the codified laws and regulations) and informal institutions (norms, values and codes of conduct). The aim of this article is to further advance this institutional approach by evaluating the varying degrees of informalization of entrepreneurs and then analysing whether lower levels of formalization are associated with higher levels of institutional asymmetry. To do this, a 2012 survey of the varying degrees of informalization of 300 entrepreneurs in Pakistan is reported. The finding is that 62% of entrepreneurs operate wholly informal enterprises, 31% largely informal and 7% largely formal enterprises. None operate wholly formal enterprises. Those displaying lower levels of formalization are shown to be significantly more likely to display higher levels of institutional asymmetry, exhibiting greater concerns about public sector corruption, possessing lower tax morality and being more concerned about high tax rates and the procedural and distributive injustice and unfairness of the authorities. These entrepreneurs tend to be lower-income, younger and less-educated entrepreneurs. The article concludes by discussing the theoretical and policy implications of these findings.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Earthquake early warning systems (EEWSs) that rapidly trigger risk-reduction actions after a potentially-damaging earthquake is detected are an attractive tool to reduce seismic losses. One brake on their implementation in practice is the difficulty in setting the threshold required to trigger pre-defined actions: set the level too high and the action is not triggered before potentially-damaging shaking occurs and set the level too low and the action is triggered too readily. Balancing these conflicting requirements of an EEWS requires a consideration of the preferences of its potential end users. In this article a framework to define these preferences, as part of a participatory decision making procedure, is presented. An aspect of this framework is illustrated for a hypothetical toll bridge in a seismically-active region, where the bridge owners wish to balance the risk to people crossing the bridge with the loss of toll revenue and additional travel costs in case of bridge closure. Multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) is used to constrain the trigger threshold for four owners with different preferences. We find that MAUT is an appealing and transparent way of aiding the potentially controversial decision of what level of risk to accept in EEW.",

    "title": "Champions' perspectives on implementing the National Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Ageing and Aged Care Strategy in Queensland",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Objective The National Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI) Ageing and Aged Care Strategy was introduced by the Commonwealth Government in 2012. The present study explored perceptions of the first Aged Care Champions (trained employees) of the opportunities, challenges and barriers to implementing the Strategy in Queensland. Methods The present study was an exploratory study of Champions who were nominated by their providers to build capacity around the Strategy for introduction into their organisations. The Champions (n \u2264 62) were surveyed before commencing their training programs. Quantitative and qualitative material was collected on how the Champions perceived the introduction of the six standards within their organisation. Results Champions perceived that there were opportunities to improve inclusivity, leverage organisational support and increase training and support to staff. Key challenges identified were internal attitudes and values, a lack of resources and a need for training and networking. Significant barriers included a lack of management support, resistant staff and pre-existing prejudicial values. Conclusions Providers and practitioners can leverage the opportunity to increase organisational levels of inclusivity, demonstrate organisational support to improve outcomes for clients and stakeholders and, importantly, provide staff training and development critical to the successful implementation of the Strategy. What is known about the topic? Many LGBTI elders have faced a lived history of oppression and discrimination and have special health care needs. As they age, their needs for greater levels of care increase, but for many so to do their concerns about receiving equitable treatment. What does this paper add? The National LGBTI Ageing and Aged Care Strategy was introduced to address the concerns and needs of LGBTI elders and ensure inclusive and supportive care. This study explores the opportunities, challenges and barriers as perceived by employees trained to introduce the Strategy into their services in Queensland. The present study is the first to explore the introduction of the Strategy from employees' perspectives. What are the implications for practitioners? In the present study, the opportunity for increasing inclusivity, levels of support and training and development were explored from an employee perspective, giving voice to this group of practitioners. Challenges, including current attitudes and values of staff and management, as well as a lack of resources and making connections and networks, are identified. Finally, barriers to the implementation of the Strategy are outlined, including levels of support, staff resistance, values and past negative histories of many LGBTI elders.",

    "title": "French sports policies for young people: fragmentation and coordination modes",
    "abstract_cleaned": "French sports policies are characterized by hefty state controls inherited from the Gaullist era. Decentralization laws enacted from 1982 onwards defined the competences of the different institutions on the diverse levels of an administrative area, thus relieving the State of some of its functions. Therefore, sports policies for young people are numerous due to the amount of people involved at various levels of public action (national, regional, local) and because several regulating bodies are implicated (the Ministries of Sport, Education and Justice), but also due to the difficulty in articulating public and private initiatives. The aim of this paper is to bring to light, through concrete examples, the problems caused by this multi-management of sport for young people in France, but also to show the original coordination modes deriving from this situation with reference to specific projects that have sometimes required complete rethinking. This process, initiated some 30 years ago, revealed a number of dead-ends incompatible with the efficiency expected from public policies. The present context of crisis and economic austerity crystallizes the faults that ought to be corrected by a better management of youth sports policy. We shall use three examples to demonstrate how the fundamental challenges of public action crisscross, within the State, between ministries, local authorities and the sports movement in particular.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "While the tourism industry and environmentalists may traditionally be strange bedfellows, the increasing conversion of land away from its natural state into unsustainable uses may result in the two becoming allies in the fight to protect remaining natural landscapes. This partnership is presented around a proposed sustainable symbiotic relationship between natural resource conservation and the competitiveness of ecotourism destinations. Under this symbiotic relationship, ecotourism destinations benefit in the form of enhanced competitiveness from the protection of quality natural resources while the conservation of natural resources is increasingly valued because these resources are realised as the foundation of the ecotourism industry and the driver of all economic benefits associated with ecotourism. This conceptual paper reviews this relationship and graphically depicts the symbiotic relationship, including the many tangential sustainable outcomes of biodiversity, flood control, water quality, carbon sequestration, and cultural heritage conservation that stem from the increased incentives ecotourism brings to natural resource conservation. The proposed symbiotic relationship between ecotourism and natural resource conservation specifically answers Shellenberger and Nordhaus' (2005) call to increasingly frame environmental issues using strong economic messages if public opinion is to be swayed towards conservation in this present political climate.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Background: Depression and anxiety are correlated with greater nicotine dependence, smoking persistence, and relapse back to smoking after a quit attempt. Menthol cigarette smoking, which is prevalent in young adults, is associated with nicotine dependence, progression to regular smoking, and worse cessation outcomes than non-menthol smoking. Few have established a link between menthol tobacco use, beyond just smoking, with mental health in this high-risk age group. This study examined the association of menthol tobacco use to anxiety and depression in a national sample of young adults. Methods: Data were from Waves 1 through 7 (n = 9720, weighted) of the Truth Initiative Young Adult Cohort, a national sample of men and women aged 18 to 34 assessed every 6-months. Demographics, past 30-day use of non-menthol and menthol tobacco products, and current alcohol, marijuana, and other drug use were assessed among those with depression and anxiety. Results: Thirty nine percent of current tobacco users used menthol as their preferred brand. Using a cross-sectional analysis (collapsed across waves), past 30-day menthol tobacco was uniquely associated with greater odds of both depression and anxiety, beyond the effects of demographic and substance correlates and non-menthol tobacco product use. Conclusions: Menthol is disproportionately used among young adults tobacco users with mental health problems, above and beyond the impact of a variety of other mental health and tobacco use risk factors. Findings suggest a strong link between menthol tobacco use and poor health outcomes. Policies should be developed to deter menthol tobacco use in vulnerable groups.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Phenol is one of the most common pollutants in many kinds of industrial wastewater, some of which are in high salinity, resulting in more difficulties of biodegradation. In this work, a halophilic strain capable of utilizing phenol as sole source of carbon and energy in both hypersaline and no-salt media was isolated and identified as genus Debaryomyces. The optimization of environmental parameters including phenol concentration, pH, dissolved oxygen as well as salinity was carried out and tolerance of heavy metals by the strain was evaluated. The strain Debaryomyces sp. was able to grow in culture when initial phenol concentration, pH, agitation and salinity were at wide ranges (0\u20131200 mg L\u22121, 4.0\u201310.0, 50\u2013200 rpm, 0 %-15 %, respectively). High removal efficiency was hardly affected in the presence of 5 mM of Zn (II) and Mn (II). Under optimal conditions (pH 6.0, 200 rpm, 1 % of salinity without heavy metals), 500 mg L\u22121 of phenol could be completely degraded within 32 h. The high removal efficiency of phenol by the strain with significant variations of process parameters might contribute to the bioremediation of phenol-polluted environments under hypersaline or no-salt conditions.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Water quality management is a significant item in the sustainable development of wetland system, since the environmental influences from the economic development are becoming more and more obvious. In this study, an inexact left-hand-side chance-constrained fuzzy multi-objective programming (ILCFMOP) approach was proposed and applied to water quality management in a wetland system to analyze the tradeoffs among multiple objectives of total net benefit, water quality, water resource utilization and water treatment cost. The ILCFMOP integrates interval programming, left-hand-side chance-constrained programming, and fuzzy multi-objective programming within an optimization framework. It can both handle multiple objectives and quantify multiple uncertainties, including fuzziness (aspiration level of objectives), randomness (pollutant release limitation), and interval parameters (e.g. water resources, and wastewater treatment costs). A representative water pollution control case study in a wetland system is employed for demonstration. The optimal schemes were analyzed under scenarios at different probabilities (pi, denotes the admissible probability of violating the constraint i). The optimal solutions indicated that, most of the objectives would decrease with increasing probability levels from scenarios 1 to 3, since a higher constraint satisfaction probability would lead to stricter decision scopes. This study is the first application of the ILCFMOP model to water quality management in a wetland system, which indicates that it is applicable to other environmental problems under uncertainties.",

However, paraffinic advanced biofuels are a mixture of paraffins naturally found also in petroleum-derived fuels. Thus, the distinction and quantification of such advanced biofuels in mixtures with biodiesel and petroleum diesel in an efficient way is a challenge for the quality control of this type of fuel blend. In this work, we present an innovative analytical method to distinguish and quantify renewable diesel and biodiesel contents in diesel fuel blends with adequate accuracy in a fast, simple and cost-effective manner through the employment of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and chemometrics. Multivariate calibration models using partial least squares (PLS) or support vector machines (SVM) provided prediction results of HEFA renewable diesel and biodiesel contents with values of root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) up to 0.5% (v/v) and relative error of prediction (REP) up to 2.7%, being adequate for real-world applications.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite that infects humans and various animal species. The environmental stability and the low infectious dose of Cryptosporidium facilitate its transmission by water and food. Discharge of untreated wastewater may result in waterborne or foodborne Cryptosporidium outbreaks, therefore a suitable treatment may prevent its dissemination. Most studies on the prevalence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in wastewater have reported a concentration range between 10 and 200 oocysts/L and a prevalence of 6 to 100%. Activated sludge has been found to be ineffective for the removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Stabilization ponds and constructed wetlands are efficient for the reduction of Cryptosporidium from wastewater, especially when the retention time is longer than 20 days at suitable sunlight and temperature. High rate filtration and chlorine disinfection are inefficient for the reduction of Cryptosporidium from effluents, whereas ultrafiltration and UV irradiation were found to be very efficient for the reduction of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Adequate tertiary treatment may result in high quality effluent with low risk of Cryptosporidium for unrestricted irrigation and other non-potable applications.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Many studies illustrate variable patterns in individual species distribution shifts in response to changing temperature. However, an assemblage, a group of species that shares a common environmental niche, will likely exhibit similar responses to climate changes, and these community-level responses may have significant implications for ecosystem function. Therefore, we examine the relationship between observed shifts of species in assemblages and regional climate velocity (i.e., the rate and direction of change of temperature isotherms). The assemblages are defined in two sub-regions of the U.S. Northeast Shelf that have heterogeneous oceanography and bathymetry using four decades of bottom trawl survey data and we explore temporal changes in distribution, spatial range extent, thermal habitat area, and biomass, within assemblages. These sub-regional analyses allow the dissection of the relative roles of regional climate velocity and local physiography in shaping observed distribution shifts. We find that assemblages of species associated with shallower, warmer waters tend to shift west-southwest and to shallower waters over time, possibly towards cooler temperatures in the semi-enclosed Gulf of Maine, while species assemblages associated with relatively cooler and deeper waters shift deeper, but with little latitudinal change. Conversely, species assemblages associated with warmer and shallower water on the broad, shallow continental shelf from the Mid-Atlantic Bight to Georges Bank shift strongly northeast along latitudinal gradients with little change in depth. Shifts in depth among the southern species associated with deeper and cooler waters are more variable, although predominantly shifts are toward deeper waters. In addition, spatial expansion and contraction of species assemblages in each region corresponds to the area of suitable thermal habitat, but is inversely related to assemblage biomass. This suggests that assemblage distribution shifts in conjunction with expansion or contraction of thermal habitat acts to compress or stretch marine species assemblages, which may respectively amplify or dilute species interactions to an extent that is rarely considered. Overall, regional differences in climate change effects on the movement and extent of species assemblages hold important implications for management, mitigation, and adaptation on the U.S. Northeast Shelf.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Swidden cultivation is one of the most widespread agricultural systems in the tropics. Due to socio-economic changes, swiddens are either abandoned, substituted for other agricultural systems, or intensified. In the region of the middle Amazon river, Brazil, the high market demand for cassava flour (farinha) combined with land scarcity is inducing agricultural intensification. We define agricultural intensification as an increase in the frequency of swidden-fallow cycles and a decrease in the fallow period. In this study, we evaluate the consequences of agricultural intensification for management practices and swidden productivity in one of the main cassava producing areas of the Brazilian Amazon. We used ethnographic and biophysical surveys to characterize the current management practices and to evaluate the effect of repeated swidden-fallow cycles within a short fallow period regime on swidden size, weed infestation and life-form composition, weeding effort and cassava productivity. Our results show that with repeated swidden-fallow cycles cassava yield decreases, weed cover increases and weed composition changes from a tree-dominated to a graminoid-dominated community. Such changes in the weed community result in increased weeding effort, to which farmers respond by cultivating smaller swiddens. Therefore, the ongoing agricultural intensification leads to lower swidden productivity and household income without ensuing clear benefits for farmers. Limited access to fertilizers, herbicides and technical assistance combined with the market demand for a single product hinders adaptation. Broadening market opportunities and improving technical assistance to farmers could raise the diversification of production and sources of income and guarantee higher resilience to the system.",

The present study was conducted to assess the relationship between physico-chemical parameters and phytoplankton assemblages of Baldi stream of Garhwal Himalayas, India. Results showed an increased concentration in physico-chemical parameters (turbidity, total dissolved solids, nitrates and phosphates) has an adverse impact on the density of phytoplankton during monsoon season at the sampling site S2, where maximum disturbances were recorded. Karl Pearson's correlation coefficient calculated between physico-chemical parameters and density of phytoplankton revealed that as sediment load increases in the stream, the growth of phytoplankton decreases. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) between environmental variables and dominant taxa of phytoplankton indicated the influence of physico-chemical parameters on phytoplankton distribution in freshwater ecosystem of Baldi stream of Garhwal Himalayas, India.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Agroforestry offers proven strategies as an environmentally benign and ecologically sustainable land management practice to promote ecosystem services. In this literature review, we systematically consider the agroforestry and ecosystem services literature with the aim to identify and catalogue the knowledge field and provide the first systematic synthesis of ecosystem services research in relation to European agroforestry. We reviewed 71 scientific publications from studies conducted in farmland and forest ecosystems with various types of agroforestry management. Each publication was systematically characterized and classified by agroforestry practice and research approach in order to provide an insight into the current research state in addressing ecosystem services (including methods, indicators, and approaches). Spatial distribution of the case study sites in Europe was also explored. In addition, typical clusters of similar research approaches were identified. The results show that ecosystem service assessment of European agroforestry is currently focused on the spatially extensive wood pastures in the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Continental agricultural mosaic landscapes. A specific emphasis has been on regulating, supporting, and provisioning services, such as provision of habitat and biodiversity, food, climate regulation, fibre, and fuel, and the consideration of cultural services has been largely limited to aesthetic value. There is a bias to biophysical and monetary research approaches. The majority of the studies focus on quantitative methods and biophysical field measurements addressing the assessment of only one or two services. Monetary approaches have been applied in less than one fifth of the studies but form a distinctive group. Our results highlight gaps and biases in the ecosystem service research agenda within agroforestry based on which we conclude that research should aim to diversify from the biophysical and monetary approaches, towards a wider variety of approaches, especially socio-cultural, and a wider coverage of ecosystem services. Stronger consideration of stakeholder participation and introduction of spatially explicit mapping are also important key actions. We make suggestions to advance the promise of ecosystem services provision from European agroforestry in decision making including various actors, stakeholders, and institutions, with strong links to policy processes, such as the EU Biodiversity Strategy and Common Agricultural Policy.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Emerging diseases often originate from host shifts of introduced pests or pathogens. Genetic resistance of the host to such diseases might be limited or absent due to the lack of coevolutionary history. We review six examples of major disease outbreaks on native tree species caused by different introduced pests and pathogens that led to large ecological and economical losses. In all six cases, high tree mortality was observed in natural populations with some surviving individuals exhibiting varying levels of genetic resistance. The abundance and distribution of resistant individuals and the heritability of resistance traits varies substantially among the cases. While chestnut blight wilt combined with ink disease has virtually eliminated mature Castanea dentata trees from North America, other severe emerging diseases, such as the ash dieback, have left many surviving trees and genetic variation in resistance to such diseases has been documented. We argue that the evolutionary potential of tree species to respond to new emerging diseases should not be underestimated. However, the risk of increased levels of inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity caused by low population sizes is a major concern. Maintenance of broad genetic diversity is an important issue in conservation and forestry management. We expect that future research targeting the genetic background of biotic resistance towards emerging diseases and the role of endophytic communities in protecting trees will facilitate the informed and science-based guidance required to manage and maintain forests with high resilience. International cooperation on limiting disease spread and the provision of early invasive pest or pathogen detection systems are essential.",

It has been suggested that automatic optimised operation schemes for PCS should be introduced to avoid energy wastage and discomfort caused by inappropriate operation. In certain automatic operation schemes, personalised thermal sensation models are applied as key components to help in setting targets for PCS operation. In this research, a novel personal thermal sensation modelling method based on the C-Support Vector Classification (C-SVC) algorithm has been developed for PCS control. The personal thermal sensation modelling has been regarded as a classification problem. During the modelling process, the method 'learns' an occupant's thermal preferences from his/her feedback, environmental parameters and personal physiological and behavioural factors. The modelling method has been verified by comparing the actual thermal sensation vote (TSV) with the modelled one based on 20 individual cases. Furthermore, the accuracy of each individual thermal sensation model has been compared with the outcomes of the PMV model. The results indicate that the modelling method presented in this paper is an effective tool to model personal thermal sensations and could be integrated within the PCS for optimised system operation and control.",

It is known that butanol can be used as a biofuel to decrease the greenhouse gas emissions from transport and that butanol may overcome blend wall limitations better than ethanol. However, the GHG emissions of butanol are not well known. The study is based on two case studies: corn butanol production in the USA and sugarcane butanol production in Brazil. Results obtained for GHG emissions show 79-122 gCO2-eq/MJ for corn butanol and -55-18 gCO2-eq/MJ for sugarcane butanol. Our results suggest that in the cases studied, producing butanol from corn (with the current cultivation and process practices) does not lead to GHG emission savings. On the other hand, producing butanol from sugarcane seems to have potential for GHG emission reductions in certain conditions. We highlight the differences between these two production chains and discuss how GHG emissions from these biofuel chains could be reduced.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "As Sri Lankan water resources are being increasingly exploit1ed, particularly for hydropower and irrigation, ecologists, water practitioners and policymakers alike are realizing the importance of protecting these resources and setting environmental sustainability thresholds. Environmental flows (EF) - the concept that helps define such thresholds - has now become an integral part of environmental impact assessments of river basin development projects. Considering EF is especially vital in the context of the accelerated infrastructure development program, launched after the end of the war in the north and the east of the country in 2009. This paper describes a simple, user-friendly software tool that facilitates quick, first-hand estimation of EF in Sri Lankan rivers. The tool uses 'natural' or 'unregulated' monthly flow time series, at any river location to construct a flow duration curve that is then modified depending on the desired condition of a river - an environmental management class - to generate an EF time series. The tool includes historical flow records from158 gauged locations, but users may also feed in (observed/simulated) external data. The paper illustrates the application of the tool at two locations of existing/planned infrastructure projects and discusses its usefulness as a policy tool.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The efficient water harvesting from air-laden moisture has been a subject of great interest to address world-wide water shortage issues. Recently, it has been shown that tailoring surface wettability can enhance the moisture harvesting performance. However, depending on the harvesting condition, a different conclusion has often been reported and it remains unclear what type of surface wettability would be desirable for the efficient water harvesting under the given condition. Here we compare the water harvesting performance of the surfaces with various wettability under two different harvesting conditions-dewing and fogging, and show that the different harvesting efficiency of each surface under these two conditions can be understood by considering the relative importance of the water capturing and removal efficiency of the surface. At fogging, the moisture harvesting performance is determined by the water removal efficiency of the surface with the oil-infused surfaces exhibiting the best performance. Meanwhile, at dewing, both the water capturing and removal efficiency are crucial to the harvesting performance. And well-wetting surfaces with a lower barrier to nucleation of condensates exhibit a better harvesting performance due to the increasing importance of the water capture efficiency over the water removal efficiency at dewing.",

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Salvador, Bahia, north-eastern Brazil. Subjects The study was conducted in 1019 households with students. Violence between couples was evaluated using the Portuguese version of the revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2), previously adapted and validated for use in Brazil. The Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale (BFIS) was used to identify food insecurity. We also obtained socio-economic information for each participant. We used multivariate Poisson regression to assess the associations of interest. Results According to the results of the BFIS, 62\u00b75 % of the households were found to experience food insecurity, including 19\u00b75 % moderate food insecurity and 6\u00b75 % severe food insecurity. The prevalence of minor physical violence was 9\u00b76 % (95 % CI 7\u00b78, 11\u00b74 %) and of severe physical violence was 4\u00b77 % (95 % CI 3\u00b74, 6\u00b70 %) among the couples.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Copyright  and ERP EnvironmentCommunity energy makes an important contribution to sustainable energy generation, reduction and management, and is a desirable feature of a low carbon future. Renewable community energy is increasingly gaining momentum even in the centralized UK energy market. The challenge of low carbon transitions is faced by multiple territorial governments, and requires inclusive governance arrangements in which a combination of actors work together to implement community strategies towards a climate-resilient future. Low carbon governance is a multi-level and (co-)evolving process, especially in the complex interactions between actors of the core, inner periphery and civil periphery. The devolution of power within the UK has enabled Scotland to establish an ambitious policy agenda for renewable energy. By exploring an established national community energy programme, this study examines the interplay among different actors and looks into how multi-level governance can be strengthened. This paper combines multi-level and evolutionary governance theory to understand the extent to which top-down initiatives facilitate community renewable energy projects and help drive wider system transformations. It concludes that in an evolving policy environment, top-down support for community energy is a necessary motivator. This requires the state to play a dominant role in directing low carbon transitions, while acting in concert with non-state, local and regional actors. If communities are to benefit from energy transitions, wider policies must be aligned with community needs, otherwise community energy will be pushed to the margins of the next energy revolution.

As the farmer households sponsoring \u201cfarm household tourism\u201d are scattered spatially, and vary sharply in wastewater production, it is hard to address this problem effectively with the conventional methods available. The authors have designed and tested a series of \u201ccomposite-medium bio-filter(CMB)\u201d systems, different in composition of medium, in laboratory for a continuous period of 114 days to investigate technical feasibility and effects of the CNB systems treating this kind of wastewater. Results show that when the wastewater was 2 000-4 500, 15-60 and 6-12 mg\u00b7L-1, in concentration of COD, TN and TP, respectively, on average the CMB systems could remove COD by over 90%, TN by over 80% and TP by over 70%. Mass balance analysis indicates that their NH4+ removal depended mainly on nitrification/denitrification, which was enhanced by the filling of zeolite adsorbing NH4+, while TP removal did on adsorption by the media. The addition of bamboo granules into the medium of the filter could not only stabilize the removal rate of COD and enhance that of TP, but also reduce cost. The test indicates that the CMB, easy to manage and free from any need of energy, is a promising technique for treating the wastewater from farm household tourism.",

Hence, an attempt was made to see the response of some selected nutrient efficient cultivars under different nutrient management practices in substituting for chemical fertilizers as well as on growth and yield attributes. The study over 5 years revealed a better scope for these genotypes in sustaining the productivity in low innate fertile soils like Ultisols. Screening 100 elite genotypes for their agronomic and physiological efficiency resulted in the selection of six K efficient lines, 3 each for edible and industrial uses. Evaluation of these genotypes at 4 levels (0, 50, 100, and 150 kg ha-1) of K for 3 consecutive years and computation of NUE parameters and physiologic parameters other than tuber yield, tuber quality, drought and mosaic tolerance and plant architecture resulted in identifying Aniyoor (edible) and 7 III E3-5 (industrial) as K efficient. These genotypes could perform better at K50 and K0 at which the root biomass and LAI supported their efficacy to scavenge the fixed native soil K and its better utilization. Screening 300 land races resulted in the identification of fifteen NUE lines. Experiments with three NPK efficient lines viz., Acc. No. 906, Acc. No. 766 and Acc. No. 905 indicated higher potential of Ac. No. 906 in low input management (soil test based) and in higher C sequestration.",

    "title": "Understanding factors that shape gender attitudes in early adolescence globally: A mixed-methods systematic review",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Background: Early adolescence (ages 10-14) is a period of increased expectations for boys and girls to adhere to socially constructed and often stereotypical norms that perpetuate gender inequalities. The endorsement of such gender norms is closely linked to poor adolescent sexual and reproductive and other health-related outcomes yet little is known about the factors that influence young adolescents' personal gender attitudes. Objectives: To explore factors that shape gender attitudes in early adolescence across different cultural settings globally. Methods: A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted of the peer-reviewed literature in 12 databases from 1984-2014. Four reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of articles and reviewed full text articles in duplicate. Data extraction and quality assessments were conducted using standardized templates by study design. Thematic analysis was used to synthesize quantitative and qualitative data organized by the social-ecological framework (individual, interpersonal and community/societal-level factors influencing gender attitudes). Results: Eighty-two studies (46 quantitative, 31 qualitative, 5 mixed-methods) spanning 29 countries were included. Ninety percent of studies were from North America or Western Europe. The review findings indicate that young adolescents, across cultural settings, commonly express stereotypical or inequitable gender attitudes, and such attitudes appear to vary by individual sociodemographic characteristics (sex, race/ethnicity and immigration, social class, and age). Findings highlight that interpersonal influences (family and peers) are central influences on young adolescents' construction of gender attitudes, and these gender socialization processes differ for boys and girls. The role of community factors (e.g. media) is less clear though there is some evidence that schools may reinforce stereotypical gender attitudes among young adolescents. Conclusions: The findings from this review suggest that young adolescents in different cultural settings commonly endorse norms that perpetuate gender inequalities, and that parents and peers are especially central in shaping such attitudes. Programs to promote equitable gender attitudes thus need to move beyond a focus on individuals to target their interpersonal relationships and wider social environments. Such programs need to start early and be tailored to the unique needs of sub-populations of boys and girls. Longitudinal studies, particularly from low-and middle-income countries, are needed to better understand how gender attitudes unfold in adolescence and to identify the key points for intervention.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Small-scale fishers in tropical regions of Asia are known to respond to uncertain resource fluctuations in diverse ways. Less is known of their adaptations to and motivations for fishing in severely overexploited fishing grounds. A common explanation emphasises poverty and a lack of access to alternative skills and sources of livelihood. Based on a study of small-scale fishing among coastal dwellers on Negros Island in the Philippine, I show that fishers' reasons for continuing to fish in overfished waters are more complicated than this explanation allows. To explain why better-off households remain committed to fishing when fish catch levels are generally very low, and why very poor and marginalized households drop out of fishing under such conditions, I combine a diverse livelihoods approach with literatures that focus on issues of power, politics and social exclusion. I differentiate among different kinds of small-scale fishing and track changes in these over time. I pay close attention to fishermen's own conception of their work and the status distinctions made among them, and examine the socio-institutional arrangements of coastal livelihoods more broadly.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Evangelical Protestants make up the largest religious subgroup in the United States, and previous research has shown that Evangelical churches are disproportionately active in community engagement and efforts toward social change. Although Evangelical Protestant perspectives have been considered with regard to persistent socioeconomic stratification and racial discrimination, less focus has been given to how churches interpret poor health outcomes within the United States. In particular, this research addresses how enduring health disparities are understood within the larger discussion of healthcare reform. Due to the similarity of approaches favored by participants in this study and community-based philosophy, a suggestion is made for future health policy dialogue. Although Evangelical Protestants have been most likely to reject all aspects of the Affordable Care Act, in many ways the findings of this study suggest the potential for successful future health policy collaboration. In particular, community-based primary care might appeal to Evangelicals and health professionals in the ongoing effort to improve population health and the quality of healthcare in the United States.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The knowledge of natural spatial patterns of variability is crucial to discriminate between natural changes and human-induced effects and to plan monitoring programs and impact evaluation studies. The present study aimed at estimating the spatial variability of coralligenous habitat, one of the main important habitats of the Mediterranean Sea, at several spatial scales. Specifically, the following hypotheses were tested: i) the structure of coralligenous assemblage and ii) the abundance of main taxa/groups both changed among different spatial scales differently depending on protection. A hierarchical sampling design was used to study 14 localities (7 Marine Protected Areas and 7 unprotected) at multiple spatial scales through photographic recording. The study suggested that, in protected conditions, the structure of coralligenous assemblages mostly varied at small spatial scale (m apart), while the structure is similar across different localities, sites and areas, even if the abundance of the main taxa/morphological groups changed. In unprotected conditions, variability among localities was higher than among Marine Protected Areas, while an opposite trend was observed at the smaller spatial scales.",

In this paper we propose methodologies by which technical coefficients of direct use of water in different hydrographic regions of the Piranhas-Acu basin under study can be stated in monetary terms for the economic sectors associated with urban supply (US) and the agricultural irrigation (AI). The technical coefficients we have calculated are a different means of presenting well-established coefficients in the basics of Input-Output Analysis. In the case of economic sectors associated with the US, the coefficients showed that at a certain level of urbanization, the amount of water used increases more than the economic product of the sector. The coefficients of AI obtained are much lower than those of the US and, when calculated by crop, showed that in the basin, trhee is an inadequate mix of crops and a low water use efficiency, resulting in low economic value per cubic meter of water allocated to the sector. This implies, for both economic sectors, a need for incentives to use water in a more efficient way in the basin.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Social sustainability is gaining importance in the international urban development context; however, in India, the concept is unclear and under-represented. New approaches and tools at the level of urban policy, design and implementation are highly biased towards environmental sustainability focussing on \u201csmart\u201d technological innovations. This scant focus, coupled with massive and inequitable urban growth, is resulting in social crises that not only pose danger to the country\u2019s stability but also represent some of the fundamental challenges to its sustainable future. Based on a detailed review of the literature on social sustainability, this paper explores its meaning and sets out its core components. It calls for humanising Indian cities and argues that a more comprehensive approach to the constituent but neglected \u201csocial\u201d dimension of sustainable development which goes beyond the technical aspects of solving infrastructure-focused social issues to creating built environments that nurture strong urban communities is necessary. Analytical findings are translated into the social sustainability framework, which suggests a combination of (micro-level variables of) bottom-up and (macro-level variables of) top-down approaches in its implementation, because nurturing social sustainability in cities needs both, planned context and emergent actions.",

The patient was a 19-year-old woman who had a medical history of asthma, but no history of surgery. She had been injured in a fall, and several surgeries were scheduled for multiple bone fractures. At the first surgery under general anesthesia, she developed anaphylaxis 5 min after sugammadex administration. A second general anesthesia for treatment of calcaneal fracture was induced uneventfully without neuromuscular blockade after 10 days. A third general anesthesia was scheduled to reinforce the spinal column 12 days after the first surgery. She developed anaphylaxis 8 min after rocuronium administration. The level of plasma histamine was elevated, but serum tryptase level remained normal. This surgery was canceled and rescheduled without use of a neuromuscular blockade. Skin tests were performed in a later investigation. The patient showed positive results on intradermal tests for sugammadex and rocuronium, supporting a diagnosis of allergic reactions to both drugs. Clinicians must be aware that anaphylactic reactions can be induced by both sugammadex and rocuronium.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Introduction Federal recommendations for providing quality family planning services were published in 2014 and included preconception care (PCC). This paper aims to describe the prevalence of PCC delivery among publicly funded clinics, prior to the recommendations. Methods Prevalence of providing occasional or frequent PCC in the last 3 months and having written protocols for recommended PCC screenings were estimated in 2015 using survey data collected from a nationally representative sample of publicly funded clinic administrators (2013\u20132014, N=1,615). Analyses included examination of differential distributions of outcomes by clinic characteristics (p<0.05) and multivariable regression. Results Prevalence of occasional or frequent PCC delivery was 81% for women and 38% for men. The percentage of clinics with written protocols for specific PCC screenings ranged from 74% to 88% (women) and 66% to 83% (men). Prevalence of having written protocols for all PCC screenings was 29% for women and 22% for men. Characteristics negatively associated with having written protocols for all PCC screenings for women and men (respectively) were as follows: not receiving Title X funding (adjusted prevalence ratio [APR]=0.6, 95% CI=0.50, 0.76; APR=0.6, 95% CI=0.47, 0.77) and being a community health center (APR=0.5, 95% CI=0.37, 0.72; APR=0.5, 95% CI=0.30, 0.67); health department (APR=0.7, 95% CI=0.61, 0.87; APR=0.6, 95% CI=0.49, 0.76); or hospital/other (APR=0.6, 95% CI=0.50, 0.79; APR=0.6, 95% CI=0.43, 0.75) (versus Planned Parenthood).

Understanding LULC changes is useful for early detection and management of land-use change to reduce the spread of invasive species. The primary objective of this study is to analyze and predict LULC changes in Connecticut. LULC maps for 1996, 2001 and 2006 were selected to analyze past land cover changes, and then potential LULC distribution in 2018 was predicted using the Multi-Layer Perceptron Markov Chain (MLP_MC) model. This study shows that the total area of forest has been decreasing, mainly caused by urban development and other human activity in Connecticut. The model predicts that the study area will lose 5535 ha of deciduous forest and gain 3502 ha of built-up area from 2006 to 2018. Moreover, forests near built-up areas and agriculture lands appear to be more vulnerable to conversion. Changes in LULC may result in subtle spatial shifts in invasion risk by an abundant invasive shrub, Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii). The gain of developed areas at the landscape scale was most closely linked to increased future invasion risk. Our findings suggest that the forest conversion needs to be controlled and well managed to help mitigate future invasion risk.",

The aim is to demonstrate how norm-conform behaviour unfolds, or fails to unfold, in an interaction between a member state and the European Commission. The empirical focus is on recent rule of law crises in France, Hungary and Romania. The argument is that member states engage in symbolic and/or creative compliance, designed to create the appearance of norm-conform behaviour without giving up their original objectives. The cases illustrate that creative and symbolic compliance strategies may be successfully employed by member states because they enable the Commission to disengage from conflicts it judges too costly and yet maintain its credibility, and are conditioned by the visibility of failure to change facts on the ground. The implication is that, at times, not only is compliance symbolic, but also to some extent is enforcement.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Today, Photovoltaic (PV) systems are very popular for power generation because they enjoy the advantage of being pollution free abundant natural resource, low maintenance cost and noiseless operation. Photovoltaic (PV) systems needs maximum power point tracking (MPPT) to maximize the PV array power output which is independent of the temperature, irradiation conditions and electrical characteristics of the load. The Research Work introduces photovoltaic MPPT system based on PIC18F452 to achieve maximum power tracking. Moreover, the combination of boost circuit and PIC18F452 microcontroller is used for tracking of the maximum power generation from PV system. Moreover, Research presents a practical implementation of Perturbation and Observation (P&O), Incremental Conductance (IncCon) and Fuzzy Logic algorithms to achieve MPPT control. These algorithms are widely used because of its low-cost and ease of realization. Proposed P&O, Incremental Conductance and Fuzzy Logic algorithms are implemented and tested under different loads, and the test results are analyzed and compared. The results show the performance of the Fuzzy Logic and Incremental Conductance algorithm in tracking MPP is better than the P&O algorithm and the experimental results of Fuzzy Logic and Incremental Conductance algorithm indicate the feasibility and improved system functionality with high-efficiency. Also, results concludes that the design can effectively accomplish the purpose of the maximum power tracking.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Buildings in Europe account for 40% of total primary energy consumption and 36% of CO2 emissions. Nearly one-half of the building stock was built before modern energy efficiency standards and need urgent renovation. Urban retrofitting has emerged as a crucial factor for bringing about a radical change, the new construction rate being lower than 1%. Nevertheless, an accepted and consolidated methodology for refurbishing the existing housing stock is still lacking. The study presents an operating methodology for the optimization of the retrofitting process, based on energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness, as well as users' comfort, in the building asset of ITEA SpA, the social housing institute for the Province of Trento (Italy), which manages more than 600 buildings. The research consists of the following stages: (1) definition of building classes, similar in age, dimension, typology, construction system and location; (2) analysis of plant systems and recognition of cases significant for classifying buildings in term of energy class; (3) identification of possible improvements and related cost-benefits; and (4) extension of the results to the whole building class. A tool is here proposed, intended for use by ITEA in order to set medium- and long-term plans. The tool does not consider only the effective sustainability of the controlling body intervention but also the final users' full satisfaction.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Recently, predicting the road accident severity has attracted great attention since timely prediction is important to minimize the damage by the accidents. The problem we address in this study is to predict the severity of road accidents based on various machine learning techniques, such as decision trees, artificial neural networks, Bayesian networks, support vector machines (SVMs), and regression models. We also present the comparative analysis among those machine learning techniques. Our classification models are developed by employing the accident-related input parameters based on 25,374 accident records occurred in Seoul, Korea over a 3-year period (from 2009 to 2011). For each accident, 30 attributes were collected at the time of accident. Through data preprocessing, our data were reduced to 12 attributes and three accident severity classes (Possible injury accident, Incapacitating and non-incapacitating evident injury accident, and Fatal accident). In this study, IBM SPSS Modeler that is the commercial data-mining S/W was used to build our classification models. The accident data were split into two disjoint sets, a training set (66.7%) for constructing the models and a test set (33.3%) for validating the models. The experimental results revealed that SVM outperforms others in terms of prediction accuracy, and other classification models also achieved the considerable classification accuracy.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The goal of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the roles of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD +) under UNFCCC has triggered a new discussion on forest resource assessments in these countries. The international process on measurement, reporting and verification of REDD + outcomes (REDD + MRV) expands the scope of forest inventories to include quantification of forest carbon stocks and their changes for results-based REDD + payments. UNFCCC decisions also specify methods to be used, and actors to be involved. Although forest management in developing countries has clearly been influenced by international processes in the past, exactly how and to what extent REDD + MRV has affected institutional arrangements for forest assessments in developing countries remains unknown. Using as a theoretical framework Discursive-Institutionalism, a concept derived from political science, this paper examines (1) the historical evolution of institutional arrangements for forest inventories in Peru; and (2) how and to what extent their development has been shaped by international processes on forests, and, more recently, specifically by REDD + MRV. The findings show that the international REDD + MRV discussion has expanded the objectives of forest assessments in Peru, inspired the mobilization of new actors and resources, and spawned the development of new protocols for forest assessments. However, the \u2018depth\u2019 of these changes is not yet extensive, since the new rules for forest inventories have not yet been formally adopted, and the institutes envisaged to implement forest inventories, including measurement of carbon stocks and their changes, have not been established.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "A model developed to describe long-term cross-shore (CS) exchange of sand and resulting profile evolution at regional scale was employed to simulate the evolution at three different sites. The model consists of modules for calculating dune erosion and overwash, bar-berm material exchange, and dune build-up by wind-blown sand transport, as described in detail in a companion paper (Larson et al., 2016). Selected study sites represent coastal stretches influenced by beach nourishment (Barra in Portugal), overwash and breaching (Macaneta spit in Mozambique), and dune development (\u00c4ngelholm in Sweden). The model applications showed overall good performance and the results of the simulations are promising. Due to limitations in data availability in \u00c4ngelholm and Macaneta, values on calibration parameters were mainly determined based on previous studies. For Barra, where more field measurements were available, the application showed good agreement between the simulated results and observations. The CS-model proved to be a useful tool to predict long-term evolution of beach-dune systems in a time perspective from years to decades. However, additional efforts should be directed towards improving the schematized model profile so that it can better represent other beach shapes such as a sloping berm or a barrier shape.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) is the frontrunner in fisheries certification, receiving both extensive support and strong criticisms. The increasing uptake by fisheries and markets (almost 10% of world fisheries tonnage engaged by the end of 2014) has been followed by a widening pool of stakeholders interacting with the MSC. However, the applicability of the MSC approach for fisheries in the developing world (DW) remains doubtful, reinforced by a worldwide uptake skewed towards developed world fisheries. Here, a group of MSC stakeholders, with the aid of an ad-hoc questionnaire survey, reviews constraints to MSC certification in DW fisheries, evaluates solutions put forward by the MSC, and recommends actions to improve MSC uptake by DW fisheries. Recommendations to the MSC include researching and benchmarking suitable data-limited assessment methods, systematizing and making readily available the experiences of certified fisheries worldwide and constructing specific fisheries capacity-building for regional leaders. The MSC can further review the certification cost, especially for small-scale fisheries and, in partnership with other institutions, mobilize a fund to support specific DW fishery types. This fund could also support the development of market opportunities and infrastructures likely to satisfy local conditions and needs. For wider market intervention, the MSC should consider embarking on some form of vertical differentiation. Finally, for fisheries that may never move towards certification, the group identifies tools and experiences available at MSC that can improve environmental performance and governance bearing.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation-plus as an important measure to mitigate climate change can effectively reduce the emissions caused by deforestation and degradation in tropical countries. It is particularly important in the projects of reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation-plus that carbon emission monitoring and reference emission levels are tied to the revenues of a country. However, how do the reference emission levels and information of emissions influence project performance is still uncertain. Within a theoretical analysis framework, this paper considers the confliction among landholder behaviors, goals of policymakers, as well as the distortion caused by the existence of asymmetric information. The theoretical framework reveals two hypotheses through comparing optimal decisions under different scenarios: (i) an increase in reference emission levels can lead to a decrease in landholders\u2019 efforts and an increase in actual emissions; (ii) information asymmetry caused by the increase of landholder's forest area results in an increase in emissions. The empirical study uses panel data for 75 developing countries to test these hypotheses. The results show that a monitoring, reporting and verification system can help achieve the social optimum level for emissions and the efforts by landholders. An increase in the forest areas owned by landholders and in REL will lead to an increase in emissions. The empirical results also confirm this point at a global scale, as well as regionally in Africa, Latin America & the Caribbean, and Asia &Oceania. As solutions for these problems, an effective monitoring, reporting and verification system is crucial in successful implementation of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation-plus.",

Study design We prospectively collected data on all referrals from March 2010 to December 2012, seen by the seven local teams within the cancer network. Results Over 7000 patient-episodes were analyzed. We found an AOS has the greatest impact on reducing hospital stay of patients admitted with complications of cancer treatment, compared with patients presenting with cancer symptoms, or those presenting with a new cancer as an emergency. Also an AOS significantly reduces the mortality rate of patients admitted with complications of cancer treatment, compared with patients presenting with cancer symptoms, either of a known cancer or those patients presenting with a new cancer as an emergency. Conclusions Our network establishment of an AOS has had a positive impact on the quality of care cancer patients receive, in addition to saving local trusts valuable bed days, due to the overall reduction in hospital stay. This study also highlights deficiencies in the cancer journeys of certain patients with cancer, such as patients who present with a new cancer as an emergency admission, or patients unable to be discharged due to a lack of community resources. Such analysis is important in highlighting where the AOS can concentrate resources and collaborate with other healthcare professionals, especially within the local community.",

Responses of lotic systems to the treated wastewater effluent have been traditionally investigated by examining the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages and community structure; however, these studies do not address the microbial diversity of the water systems. In the present study, planktonic and benthic bacterial community structure were examined at 14 sites (from 60 m upstream to 12,100 m downstream) and at two time points along an aquatic system receiving treated effluent from the Charleston Wastewater Treatment Plant (Charleston, IL). Total bacterial DNA was isolated and 16S rRNA sequences were analyzed using a metagenomics platform. The community structure in planktonic bacterial communities was significantly correlated with dissolved oxygen concentration. Benthic bacterial communities were not correlated with water quality but did have a significant geographic structuring. A local restructuring effect was observed in both planktonic and benthic communities near the treated wastewater effluent, which was characterized by an increase in abundance of sphingobacteria. Sites further downstream from the wastewater facility appeared to be less influenced by the effluent. Overall, the present study demonstrated the utility of targeted high-throughput sequencing as a tool to assess the effects of treated wastewater effluent on a receiving water system, and highlighted the potential for this technology to be used for routine monitoring by wastewater facilities.",

Investments in education serve as an important pathway out of poverty, yet reduced agricultural productivity due to droughts or temperature shocks may affect educational attainment if children receive poorer nutrition during early childhood, are required to participate in household income generation during schooling ages, or if households can no longer pay for school-related expenses. We link longitudinal socioeconomic, demographic, and schooling data from the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey to high-resolution gridded climate data to measure exposure to temperature and precipitation relative to historical norms. We then estimate a set of multivariate regression models to understand how climate variability impacts grade attainment and school enrollment. Results indicate that early life climatic conditions \u2013 namely milder temperatures during all seasons and greater rainfall during the summer agricultural season \u2013 are associated with an increased likelihood of a child having completed any education. In addition, greater summer rainfall during both early life and school ages is associated with having completed any schooling as well as with attending school at the time of the survey. These findings suggest that future climate change may reduce children's school participation in rural Sub-Saharan Africa, slowing progress toward human development goals and poverty alleviation.",

This study intended to develop a method for the prediction of the instantaneous building energy load, depending on various combinations of input parameters using a dynamic neural network model. The heating load was calculated for a typical apartment building in Seoul for a one-month period in winter using the Energy-Plus software. The data sets obtained were used to train neural network models. The input parameters included dry-bulb temperature, dew point temperature, direct normal radiation, diffuse horizontal radiation, and wind speed. The Taguchi method was applied to investigate the effect of the individual input parameters on the heating load. It was found that the outdoor temperature and wind speed are the most influential parameters, and that the dynamic model provides better results, as compared with the static model. Optimized system parameters, such as number of tapped delay lines and number of hidden neurons, were obtained for the present application. The results of this study show that Taguchi method can successfully reduce number of input parameters. Moreover dynamic neural network model can predict precisely instantaneous heating loads using a reduced number of inputs.",

The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind power impact the function of bulk power system. The renewable energy generation is intermittent and uncertain, which introduces challenges in power system operation and control. Solutions to overcome the frequency and power flow fluctuations due to the uncertain energy generation needs further research and development. Predicting variable generation of renewable energy sources in short term intervals has become an interesting area of study, which can be applied to control the power and frequency fluctuations. In this study, a cellular computational network (CCN) based prediction method is presented to predict the solar irradiance for utility-scale PV plants. Modern utility-scale PV plants are designed as spatially distributed number of modular PV plants. Use of spatial information can improve the prediction accuracy in a single PV plant location. Neighboring plant units' weather information is used to predict the solar irradiance in individual locations. Predictions are done using archived data from Oahu solar measurement grid, Oahu, Hawaii, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Typical prediction results are compared with different CCN configurations.",

Methods: A cohort of patients with RA initiating a first TNFi 2001-2012 was identified in the Swedish Biologics Register. The association between European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response after 3-8 months of treatment (assessed using the first, the best and the measurement closest to 5 months, respectively), and the risk of incident ACS during the subsequent year was analysed in Cox regression models. Adjustments included cardiovascular risk factors, joint surgery, RA duration, education and work disability. Results: During 6592 person-years among TNFi initiators (n=6864, mean age 55 years, 77% women), 47 ACS occurred. The adjusted HRs (95% CI), which were similar to the crude HRs, of the 1-year risk of ACS among EULAR good responders compared with non-responders were 0.5 (0.2 to 1.4), 0.4 (0.2 to 0.9) and 0.5 (0.2 to 1.2), for the first, the best and the evaluation closest to 5 months, respectively. EULAR moderate responders had equal risk to that of EULAR non-responders, who, compared with the general population referents (n=34 229), had a more than twice the risk of ACS. For good responders, there was no statistically significant difference in risk versus the general population. Conclusions: Optimised RA disease control has the potential to revert otherwise increased risks for ACS in RA.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Appearance of various trace and/or emerging pollutants and deteriorated water pollution events challenge existing analytical methods and water treatment technologies. In the past 15 years, a technology termed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) has been widely used for detecting various types of environmental analytes and for improving the water treatment efficiency. In this review, SPR principles and surface modification methods are summarized. Applications of SPR in the environmental detection of heavy metals, organic pollutants and bacteria over the past decade are illustrated. In addition, the use of SPR in monitoring microbial attachment, movement, and biofilm growth and in characterizing antifouling materials is described. While SPR is widely used, there are still considerably more capacities that can be exploited to fully utilize SPR in the investigation of the water pollution control process.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The purpose of the REACH Regulation is to ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment as well as the free circulation of substances on the internal market while enhancing competitiveness and innovation. To this end, REACH introduces, among other instruments, the authorisation regime for substances of very high concern (SVHC) that are listed on Annex XIV of the regulation. After expiration of the transitional period for each Annex XIV-SVHC, articles, such as most products of daily use, produced in the European Economic Area (EEA) may not contain such substances unless an authorisation was granted for the specific use or this use falls within the scope of an exemption from the authorisation requirement. The authorisation scheme does, however, only apply to SVHC used in the EEA. As a consequence, REACH does not regulate SVHC entering the European market as part of imported articles which burden human health and the environment. Moreover, from an economic perspective, domestic articles are subject to stricter requirements than those which are produced abroad, putting actors from within the EEA at competitive disadvantage and thus impeding the intention of REACH to enhance competitiveness and innovation. One option to close this regulatory gap could be to extend the authorisation requirement to SVHC present in imported articles. A legal appraisal on behalf of the German Environment Agency (UBA) assesses whether such option would be in accordance with the specifications of WTO world trade law. It concludes that, measured by the standards of the WTO dispute settlement practice, such an extended authorisation scheme would neither violate the principles of national treatment and most-favoured nation treatment. Also, such regulation would not constitute an unnecessary obstacle to trade, since the extended authorisation requirement would pursue a legitimate objective covered by the regulatory autonomy of the EU and, furthermore, the regulation would not be more trade-restrictive than necessary. The contribution at hand summarises the main findings while taking into account first reactions to the legal appraisal.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Land use is a key component to the sustainability of a city. Land-use planning policy should not be based solely on the hard figures, but also needs observational insights. Existing assessment methods and corresponding indexes may not provide comprehensive evaluation on sustainability practices. Therefore, a qualitative, comprehensive method is required to supplement sustainable land-use evaluation. This study developed a comprehensive evaluation framework embracing views from experts and the public for assessing land-use sustainability and applied it to the case of Hong Kong. Experts were interviewed to explain the relationship between land-use transition and impact factors, and through questionnaire survey, residents provided their ranking scores on the economic, environmental, and social performances to land-use change. A subsequent investigation was then conducted to understand/validate the different opinions given by experts and residents on sustainability. Finally, according to the questionnaire, survey, and supplementary investigation, the evaluation results were calculated and public evaluation criteria were formulated. The result also shows that Hong Kong's land-use change in 2000-2010 is only marginally sustainable, with Open space to the best and decreased Grassland to the worst. The primary criteria of public requirement in economic, environmental, and social aspects are promoted productivity and labor force, extended natural space, and available resources. The proposed qualitative evaluation framework could be used to obtain the public view on the whole city's land-use performance, providing new perspectives for planners and decision makers to move a city toward more sustainable land use by mitigating negative impacts, encouraging the most sustainable land-use, and balancing economic, environmental, and social effects. In addition, criteria for land-use assessment developed from a new perspective can be applied in China's urban systems for sustainability assessment.",

Soil-organic amendment (SOA) is one of the sustainable soil improvement measures to mitigate climate change related issues such as rainfall-induced hazard and soil erosion. Organic wastes particularly compost and biochar can be reused and recycled into viable resources. However, there are limited data on incoporating organic wastes into a soil that is susceptible to erosion by rainfall. Therefore, objective of this study is to investigate properties of a soil from Okinawa prefecture (Kunigami maaji) that are associated with resisting ability against artificial rainfall intensities of 30, 60, 90 and 120 mm/h after adding two organic matters: household-derived compost and rice hush-derived biochar. The properties were soil-water retention, runoff, soil loss, infiltration and electrical conductivity. The compost was mixed with the soil at application rates of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 kg/m 2 . The compost of 1.0 kg/m 2 was mixed with the soil and the biochar at application rates of 1, 3, and 5% by total weight. Experimental results indicate that the soil water retention properties of the soil were improved by the treatment of compost and biochar. However, soil loss was not significantly reduced under initially saturated soil condition, applied rainfall intensities, testing duration and experimental conditions. The results of this study could be used as baseline data for evaluating correlation between properties of soil water retention curves to soil erosion.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Deltas are among the most productive and economically important of global ecosystems but unfortunately they are also among the most threatened by human activities. Here we discuss deltas and human impact, several approaches to defining deltaic sustainability and present a ranking of sustainability. Delta sustainability must be considered within the context of global biophysical and socioeconomic constraints that include thermodynamic limitations, scale and embeddedness, and constraints at the level of the biosphere/geosphere. The development, functioning, and sustainability of deltas are the result of external and internal inputs of energy and materials, such as sediments and nutrients, that include delta lobe development, channel switching, crevasse formation, river floods, storms and associated waves and storm surges, and tides and other ocean currents. Modern deltas developed over the past several thousand years with relatively stable global mean sea level, predictable material inputs from drainage basins and the sea, and as extremely open systems. Human activity has changed these conditions to make deltas less sustainable, in that they are unable to persist through time structurally or functionally. Deltaic sustainability can be considered from geomorphic, ecological, and economic perspectives, with functional processes at these three levels being highly interactive. Changes in this functioning can lead to either enhanced or diminished sustainability, but most changes have been detrimental. There is a growing understanding that the trajectories of global environmental change and cost of energy will make achieving delta sustainability more challenging and limit options for management. Several delta types are identified in terms of sustainability including those in arid regions, those with high and low energy-intensive management systems, deltas below sea level, tropical deltas, and Arctic deltas. Representative deltas are ranked on a sustainability range. Success in sustainable delta management will depend on utilizing natural delta functioning and an ecological engineering approach.",

Research shows that it is the perception of inequality, more than raw measures of inequality, that has important political consequences and that is most concerning for social well-being. In this article, I propose a theoretical move from a general, statistically driven conceptualization of inequality to a spatially informed concept that recognizes how people experience inequality. Relying on findings that show that the perception of inequality is most important for life chances, I suggest that it is key to understand not only where inequality is located but how it is spatially distributed. Using the Mall of San Juan as an example of a spatially polarized landscape in Puerto Rico, and referring to other cases in Latin America, the article shows how the spatial distribution of inequality highlights the perceptual fields of citizens who may celebrate, succumb to, respond to, attune to, and/or challenge the inequalities accordingly. To shift from an accounting of inequality through the concept of segregation to recognizing the experience and perception of inequality through spatial polarization shifts the scholarly and policy frames of inequality research and policy.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Biomass pyrolysis and the valorization of co-products (biochar, bio-oil, syngas) could be a sustainable management solution for agricultural and forest residues. Depending on its properties, biochar amended to soil could improve fertility. Moreover, biochar is expected to mitigate climate change by reducing soil greenhouse gas emissions, if its C/N ratio is lower than 30, and sequestrating carbon if its O/Corg and H/Corg ratios are lower than 0.2 and 0.7, respectively. However, the yield and properties of biochar are influenced by biomass feedstock and pyrolysis operating parameters. The objective of this research study was to validate an approach based on the response surface methodology, to identify the optimal pyrolysis operating parameters (temperature, solid residence time, and carrier gas flowrate), in order to produce engineered biochars for carbon sequestration. The pyrolysis of forest residues, switchgrass, and the solid fraction of pig manure, was carried out in a vertical auger reactor following a Box-Behnken design, in order to develop response surface models. The optimal pyrolysis operating parameters were estimated to obtain biochar with the lowest H/Corg and O/Corg ratios. Validation pyrolysis experiments confirmed that the selected approach can be used to accurately predict the optimal operating parameters for producing biochar with the desired properties to sequester carbon.",

All but one of them varied their cognitive and bilingual strategy use according to the demands and genre of the text and their oral English proficiency. The most frequent bilingual strategies demonstrated were translating and code-mixing. Only two children used cognates. The children often employed one language to explain their reading in the other language. They displayed a wider range of strategies across two languages compared with a single language, supporting the use of a holistic bilingual perspective to assess their reading rather than a parallel monolingual perspective. Their reading profiles in the two languages were similar, suggesting cross-linguistic transfer, although the think-aloud procedures could not determine strategy transference. The findings supported a translanguaging interpretation of their bilingual reading practices. Future research on how emergent bilingual children of different ages develop translanguaging and use it to comprehend texts was recommended.",

Cities are not only destroyed but also built through conflict. They have long been arenas of friction, difference, and dissidence, and their irreducibly conflictual character manifests itself in everything from neighborhood borders, to differences of opinion and status, to ordinary encounters on the street.

Terming this search for identity as identity crisis Erikson (1971) called it a turning point, but a normative development, a period of active questioning. Acknowledging adolescent potential, measures to enable its realization, has been a subject of theorizing among researchers. This paper examines the issues that engender conflict in the Indian adolescent and discusses the role of conflict experiences and resolution in her/his identity formation. Recent socio-biological research has uncovered important relationships between teenage brain reorganization and some of the behaviours adolescents demonstrate involving peer relationships and risk-taking. It would be interesting to understand the relationship between neuro-developmental growth at adolescence and extreme behaviours, resistance patterns and adaptation. Ethnic, linguistic, caste, social class and educational diversity in India endows adolescent identity with immense variations. Keeping the universals in perspective, this paper explores the cultural specificity of dissent and defiance in familial and extra-familial contexts. Areas that are known to trigger adolescent-adult conflict within the family usually are to do with adolescent conduct, gender discrimination, academic performance and parental control. Outside the family, resistance is invited by institutional authority figures, and tension is closely linked to peer relationships, especially romantic involvements. The adolescent gives primary importance to the family above all other systems and agents of socialization. However, the family can also be a source of conflict, thus posing a dilemma for the young person. The paper also looks at the significance of the growing engagement of adolescents and youth in organized civic protests for seeking personal identity through collective dissent.",

The United Nations has called for elimination of the practice by 2030. Methods We used household survey data to measure trends in the prevalence of FGM in 22 countries. We also examined trends in the severity of the practice by measuring changes in the prevalence of flesh removal, infibulation and symbolic 'nicking' of the genitals. We evaluated the extent to which measurement error may have influenced our estimates by observing the consistency of reports for the same birth cohorts over successive survey waves. results The prevalence of all types of FGM fell in 17 of 22 countries we examined. The vast majority of women who undergo FGM have flesh removed from their genitals, likely corresponding to the partial or total removal of the clitoris and labia. Infibulation is still practised throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa. Its prevalence has declined in most countries, but in Chad, Mali and Sierra Leone the prevalence has increased by 2-8 percentage points over 30 years. Symbolic nicking of the genitals is relatively rare but becoming more common in Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea and Mali. Conclusion FGM is becoming less common over time, but it remains a pervasive practice in some countries: more than half of women in 7 of the 22 countries we examined still experience FGM. The severity of the procedures has not changed substantially over time. Rigorous evaluation of interventions aimed at eliminating or reducing the harms associated with the practice is needed.",

This development may compromise the economic viability of wastewater reuse schemes in the future. In this chapter, costs, benefits, and added-value impacts of wastewater reuse in agriculture are presented for a scheme in Germany. The case is particularly interesting as the conversion of waste products from wastewater treatment into usable inputs for agriculture results in additional added-value and promotes the emergence of circular economies (Circular economy - industrial economy ideally producing almost no waste and pollution). This direct benefit is believed to have contributed to a general support for wastewater reuse. The future of this scheme largely depends on its ability to secure the benefits of wastewater reuse in its present form as well as to implement adequate adaptation strategies to changes in the regulatory framework for the reuse of wastewater and sludge.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Though bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals has received attention in inland waters, studies of pharmaceutical bioaccumulation in estuarine and marine systems are limited. Further, an understanding of pharmaceutical bioaccumulation across size classes of organisms displaying ontogenetic feeding shifts is lacking. We selected the striped mullet, Mugil cephalus, a euryhaline and eurythermal species that experiences dietary shifts with age, to identify whether a model base, diphenhydramine, accumulated in a tidally influenced urban bayou. We further determined whether diphenhydramine accumulation differed among size classes of striped mullet over a two year study period. Stable isotope analysis identified that ontogenetic feeding shifts of M. cephalus occurred from juveniles to adults. However, bioaccumulation of diphenhydramine did not significantly increase across age classes of M. cephalus but corresponded to surface water levels of the pharmaceutical, which suggests inhalational uptake to diphenhydramine was more important for bioaccumulation than dietary exposure in this urban estuary.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The present study was planned with the objective to find out the correlation of fodder yield, HCN content and quality traits with morpho-physiological traits under two different environments. The environments were created by applying normal five irrigations in one environment (Env-N) i.e. normal environment and by skipping the second and fourth irrigation in the other environment (Env-S) i.e. water stress environment. The positive and significant correlations were found between green fodder yield and early vigour, plant height, dry matter yield, leaf area index and proline content under both the environments. The negative and statistically significant correlations were found between green fodder yield and leaf stem ratio under both the environments and also with specific leaf weight under Env-N. Positive and significant phenotypic correlations were also found between proline content and early vigor, plant height, green fodder yield and dry matter yield under both the environments. None of the phenotypic correlations of HCN content with morpho-physiological traits under Env-N and Env-S were statistically significant. Among the quality traits studied Total Soluble Sugar (TSS)(%) content showed negative correlation with early vigour under both the environments. The results of correlation analysis revealed that under the situation of increasing water stress globally, selections for high green fodder yield can be carried out by selecting for early vigor and tall plants. The genotypes with high values for leaf area index, photosynthetic capacity and proline content would be more water use efficient and high yielding.",

The objectives of this study were to describe livelihood strategies developed by fishermen to secure their livelihoods, to identify livelihood assets that support the strategies, and to describe the roles and rules of institutions in developing the strategies. In-depth interviews and participant observations were employed to collect data and information from the selected key informants. Relying on the kindness of nature, developing alternative productive activities, forecasting for unexpected future events, maintaining or enhancing the social network, and employing risk-spreading mechanisms and productivity enhancement were the identified livelihood strategies developed by fishermen. Paddy cultivation was considered as the most important alternative livelihood activity. Developing several livelihood strategies and employing more than one activity served as redundancy by which fishermen enhanced the fulfillment of food and cash for their families. The range of livelihood strategies fishermen could develop depended on livelihood assets they could utilize. Livelihood assets available in the area were classified into natural, social, human, financial, and physical capital. Social capital, however, has been the most resourceful livelihood asset. Through a social network, fishermen might obtain access to utilize other assets crucial for developing livelihood strategies. Such access was supported by customary institutions (rules and norms) that successfully facilitated redistribution of limited livelihood assets to the locals and, at the same time, promoted cooperation among them.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Women entrepreneurs in developing countries such as Ethiopia are often stereotyped as necessity-based entrepreneurs operating in the informal sector of the economy. However, there are women entrepreneurs in Ethiopia who form and develop ventures by their own choice in the formal sector of the economy. Moreover, motivation literature suggests that motivation can develop and change overtime. In this study, self-determination theory (SDT) is used as a guiding framework for improved understanding of motivation to form and develop a venture, with a special interest in how motivation changes in relation to the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Interviews with 18 women entrepreneurs in Ethiopia operating businesses in the formal sector identified autonomously motivated and controlled-motivated women entrepreneurs proposed by SDT. The findings also highlight how the type of motivation changes over time. According to SDT, autonomous motivation and motivational change overtime happen when all basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness are satisfied. The link of satisfaction of these psychological needs with entrepreneurial ecosystem providing clues for policy making and women entrepreneurship development interventions are discussed.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "It is widely recognised that urban mobility is responsible for the generation of an important proportion greenhouse gasses produced by households, at the time that it has important social and economic implications for urban sustainability. Nonetheless, in the literature few attention has been placed on the relationship between urban structure and commuting. In this paper, using travel-to-work data for the main seven metropolitan systems in Spain we investigate both the impact of polycentric urban development on labour mobility and other urban factors influencing excess commuting. In doing so, a synthetic indicator of travelled distance is constructed and correlated to polynucleation and polycentricity indexes. Also an econometric family of models is built to regress excess commuting, after controlling for urban structure, over infrastructure and transport services, labour market structure, housing amenities, commuters' income level, orographic complexity. Results suggest that effectively there is an inverse relationship between the number and size of subcentres in terms of employment (polynucleation) and the distance travelled by commuters, nevertheless, such relationship is weaker with the strength of functional linkage between subcentres and their hinterland (polycentricity), which in turns suggest the presence of other factors influencing commuting. According to regression analyses, commuting is exacerbated in areas well served by private and high capacity public transport, also in zones where employment dominates over housing, especially if jobs are basically oriented to manufacturing. On the contrary, the diversification of housing typologies reduces labour mobility. In sum, urban structure and other planning-modifiable urban attributes seem to have and endogenous potential to mitigate commuting in metropolitan systems, and consequently contribute to reduce climate change.",

This article attempts to demonstrate the potential of spatial planning to reduce the UHI effect and, hence, to contribute to climate change adaptation in compact urban areas. After a brief review of the relevant literature, the article focuses on one case study within the compact urban area of the city of Thessaloniki. The geographical, socio-economic and urban form data of the study area and its subsequent vulnerability to UHI were initially assessed. Based on these features, a local spatial planning strategy is proposed, and the study proceeds to a detailed amendment of the land use plan, within part of the vulnerable zone. This takes into account the existing urban form, the lack of resources and the availability of the spatial planning tools within the Greek spatial planning system. The main purpose of this article is to highlight the fact that, even in urban areas where the potential for intervention seems to be marginal, because of their existing form, the complexities of the local planning system and resource limitations, improvements to the UHI effect and adaptation to climate change can be achieved by better land use planning and urban design.",

Key lessons learned from previous disasters improved the speed and quality of overall coordination. Most notably, personnel with previous disaster response experience who had personal connections with other major players in the relief efforts considerably expedited interagency and transnational relief efforts. The informal professional networks among relief workers built during common training and exercises greatly facilitated the trust needed for effective and efficient cooperation, particularly in the early response phase. The Haiyan relief effort could be equally characterized as an impressive unity of effort despite the lack of standard operating procedures and shared communication platforms. The commitment of foreign assisting actors who came to the aid of the Philippines in Haiyan clearly demonstrated the increasingly globalized nature of disaster response. The ideas, practices, approaches, force capabilities, organizational redesign, and other lessons that came out of the Haiyan experience could potentially be adapted in other disaster scenarios. As global response to large-scale disasters demands a multilayered and multifaceted approach, the need for connective mechanisms becomes critical. In the coming years, the challenge remains to find more innovative ways to increase investment in disaster preparedness and to better integrate and leverage local capabilities and capacities with international response.",

Significant research and development efforts have focused on advances in upstream technologies to increases in biomass productivity and oil accumulation through media optimization and molecular manipulation of metabolic pathways. Although some biomass and oil productivity improvements have been achieved, life cycle and techno-economic analyses reported in the past five years clearly indicate that unless multiple high-value products like protein and carotenoids are extracted, algal production platform is not sustainable. This study explores selective extraction carotenoids followed by proteins from microalgae Chlorella vulgaris. Bead-milling and high-pressure homogenization were more effective than sonication in extraction of protein from C. vulgaris. Biomass to solvent ratio of 1:5 and 2 stages were optimum for maximum extraction of chlorophyll and carotenoids. Protein fraction concentrated using a 300 kDa MWCO membrane from ethanol-treated cells has comparable amino acid profile to control sample and matches up to the recommendations by FAO/WHO. For complete release of protein after ethanol extraction, a basic pH (12) is more effective than a neutral pH (7).",

A difficulty in such nexus issue is the lack of a unified base for energy and water flows analysis, which hinders sustainable energy and water resource utilization. Given that, we proposed a modified input\u2013output analysis to provide a unified framework to balance urban energy and water use, by using the case of China's capital city\u2013Beijing. First, we inventoried the energy\u2013related water consumption and water\u2013related energy consumption with emergy metric. The hybrid water flow, as the sum of the direct water flow and energy\u2013related water flow, is combined with the hybrid energy flow to build the hybrid network. Then the complex interactions between economic sectors and the nexus impacts were explored via input\u2013output analysis. The results show that Manufacture (Ma) provides the largest outflow of hybrid energy, and Agriculture (Ag) is the largest receiver. The major export\u2013import pairs of hybrid water are Ag\u2013Ma, Ma\u2013Co (Construction), Service(Se)\u2013Transportation and Mailing (Tr), Ma\u2013Se, and Tr\u2013Ma. These major export\u2013import pairs (Ma\u2013Ag) as well as Ma itself are the critical points for energy and water nexus management. The results of the nexus impacts showed that Ag, Tr, and Co are the most important sectors. This study may help identify the leverage points and regulating pathways of urban energy\u2013water system and provide a better way for mitigating the urban energy and water pressures.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Cogeneration of synthetic natural gas (SNG) and power from coal can realize both high energy conversion efficiency and low energy penalty for CO2 capture (CC). Life cycle energy use and GHG emission assessments are applied to coal based SNG and power cogeneration with CO2 capture. Four typical pathways are considered based on the main applications of SNG in China. Results show that when SNG is produced in a single product plant with CO2 capture and SNG is used for power generation, its life cycle energy use is averagely around 5% lower than that of supercritical coal power with CC and even can be comparable with ultra supercritical (USC) with CC pathway. Such low energy use is mainly due to much lower energy penalty for CO2 capture in a SNG production plant than in a post-combustion coal fired power plant. The life cycle energy use of cogeneration plant with CC is 10\u201319% lower than that of USC with CC due to system integration, the obvious higher CO2 concentration before separation and the consequent much lower energy penalties for CO2 capture. The life cycle GHG emissions of cogeneration with CC range from 135 to 150 gCO2 eq./MJ, which are obviously lower than those of all coal power pathways including USC units (10\u201317% lower than USC with CC). For steam and power cogeneration and pure vehicle operation pathways, the cogeneration technology with CO2 capture also shows obvious life cycle energy use and GHG emission advantages over its competitive pathways.",

Results of Life Cycle Assessment, Life Cycle Costing and social Life Cycle Assessment plus subsequent normalizing, weighting, and aggregation in LCSA are assessed. A closer look reveals that the choice of weighting concept has a crucial impact on results. As main outcome, the comparison illustrates that hydrogen production via electrolysis in Germany performs best if weak sustainability (equal weighting of dimensions) is assessed. Using the strong sustainability concept (considering only environmental results) Germany yields worst results mostly due to the environmental impacts of its electricity generation.",

The urban authorities responsible for city planning are therefore responsible for de\ufb01ning the eco-ef\ufb01ciency of cities for decades to come. They need clear guidelines on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the building stock in a speci\ufb01c area. The use of sustainably sourced wood in construction plays an increasingly vital part in the transition towards eco-cities. Drawing on an exemplary development site in Munich, this paper describes how the sale of building plots can be connected to an agreement to build with wood. Based on an actual research project, site-speci\ufb01c target values regarding greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of renewable material for speci\ufb01c building plots were developed by studying life cycle assessments for different buildings. Wood is introduced as a building material to achieve a minimal environmental footprint. The focus is set on linking the sale of building plots to an agreement to build primarily with wood. Target values for the buildings were developed in close cooperation with the city and were linked to the tendering of the plots. The proceedings and its implementation are shown in this paper.",

The suitability of dorsal spines of Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) was investigated as an alternative non-invasive structure to otoliths. The spatial and temporal variability of trace elements was examined, for the first time, throughout the annual growth increments (i.e. translucent and opaque bands) of Bluefin tuna spines from the Bay of Biscay. Four scanning-ablation line transects were drawn and examined using LA-ICPMS to test for differences in tracer concentrations for each spine sections. Firstly, results confirm the questionable spatial stability of tracers in dorsal fin spines. Secondly, most of the elements analyzed 88Sr, 137Ba, 24Mg, 55Mn, 7Li (biological essential elements), 66Zn and 65Cu (priority pollutants) were consistenly found above the limit of detection (LOD). Strontium and Barium showed a similar pattern throughout annuli with concentrations significantly higher in the translucent bands in the second annulus (i.e. second winter). The concentration of Magnesium displayed an increasing pattern with annulus with no differences between translucent and opaque bands. In contrast, the concentration of Manganese showed a decreasing pattern throughout annuli, with concentrations significantly higher in the opaque bands (i.e. summer bands) regardless of annulus. Lithium, Copper and Zinc showed unclear pattern, although the concentration of Zinc seems to be in sync with the deposition of annuli currently interpreted in the ageing process. Findings indicate that the chemical signature of certain biologically essential elements is preserved stable in the dorsal fin spines strengthening its use as a non-invasive alternative structure for chemistry studies in Atlantic bluefin tuna.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "35 mm (1/4\u02ba) and 12.7 mm (1/2\u02ba) thick steel plates at an ambient temperature of -10\u00b0C, are presented and discussed. As predicted by Quinton (2008), and separately Alsos (2008), the normal direction structural reaction of a steel plate subject to a moving (sliding) object that incites a plastic plate response (without causing hull fracture) is considerably weaker than that exerted on a stationary object applying the same normal direction load. The results of these experiments employing a smooth, rigid, frictionless indenter are a first step towards understanding the effects of moving (sliding) ice loads on ice-strengthened hull structures, as ice loads in this case rarely puncture the hull, have a low coefficient of friction, and have a relatively smooth indenting surface. Further, these results are highly relevant when assessing the capability of non-ice-classed hulls in marginal ice zones.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Over the past decade, for the purpose of managing the phenomenon of migration by sea, a wide number of different measures have been adopted by the European Union and its Member States. Notwithstanding the persistent need and the legal obligation to save people\u2019s lives at sea, Europe remains stocked on the protection of the security of its internal and external borders and goes ahead with the launch of Eunavfor Med\u2013Operation Sophia, the first naval mission aimed to disrupt the business model of migrant smuggling and human trafficking in the Mediterranean. The following chapter examines the factual and legal background behind the establishment of this military mission and focuses on two sensitive and interrelated aspects: the use of enforcement powers against alleged smugglers and traffickers on the one hand and the rescue of irregular migrants at sea on the other hand. While various challenges prevent the activation of the crucial military phase of Operation Sophia, the operational and legal framework applicable to incidental search and rescue interventions carried out by its naval forces appears rather unclear and problematic under different perspectives of international law, especially if the Operation will continue into Libyan territorial waters in cooperation with its unstable authorities.",

These events can affect all levels of the ecosystem, with damage to both fauna and flora. Numerous reporting structures are currently available to document spills, however there is a lack of information on small-scale events due to their magnitude and patchy distribution. To this end, volunteers may provide a useful tool in filling this data gap, especially for coastal environments with a high usage by members of the public. The potential for citizen scientists to record small-scale pollution events is explored using the UK as an example, with a focus on highlighting methods and issues associated with using this data source. An integrated monitoring system is proposed which combines citizen science and traditional reporting approaches.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Aim: Erosion of the stratospheric ozone layer together with oligotrophication of the subtropical ocean is leading to enhanced exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation in ocean surface waters. The impact of increased exposure to UVB on planktonic primary producers and heterotrophs is uncertain. Here we test the null hypothesis that net community production (NCP) of plankton communities in surface waters of the tropical and subtropical ocean is not affected by ambient UVB radiation and extend this test to the global ocean, including the polar oceans and the Mediterranean Sea using previous results. Location: We conducted experiments with 131 surface communities sampled during a circumnavigation cruise along the tropical and subtropical ocean and combined these results with 89 previous reports encompassing the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic and Southern Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea. Methods: The use of quartz (transparent to UVB radiation) and borosilicate glass materials (opaque to most UVB) for incubations allowed us to compare NCP between communities where UVB is excluded and those receiving natural UVB radiation. Results: We found that NCP varies when exposed to natural UVB radiation compared to those where UVB was removed. NCP of autotrophic communities tended to decrease under natural UVB radiation, whereas the NCP of heterotrophic communities tended to increase. However, these variations showed the opposite trend under higher levels of UVB radiation. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that earlier estimates of NCP for surface communities, which were hitherto derived using materials blocking UVB radiation were biased, with the direction and magnitude of this bias depending on the metabolic status of the communities and the underwater penetration of UVB radiation.",

Especially the offshore WPs, in areas with valuable energy potential, without legislation prohibits and without causing disturbance to the nearby community, could release enormous land for other uses (culture, recreation areas, tourism, etc.). The aim of this paper is to present a methodology for the sustainable siting of an offshore WP based on legal limitations, with a particular respect of ecological and economic resources using as example the island of Crete. It will also be considered the visual, acoustic and aesthetic disturbance of the coastal area residents and visitors and integrate them into the context. One of the essential issues that make the region unique is the undersea relief, which makes difficult the numerous and large-scale intervention, because some areas are strictly protected by the EU. Three steps have been followed: (i) exception of unsuitable areas (geological restrictions, visual and acoustical disturb and safety and of course due to environmental conditions); (ii) evaluation of environmental impacts on birdlife, Special Protection Areas and Sites of Community Importance; (iii) assessment of wind potential and needs of electricity in the regional unit of Chania, in the Western Crete.",

    "title": "Facilitating Systemic Changes Towards Green Buildings: Developing Conceptual Frameworks of Socio-Technical Transitions",
    "abstract_cleaned": "The building industry is a major contributor to various grand challenges e.g. climate change. Green buildings have been regarded by many as the solutions and opportunities to improve the environmental sustainability of the built environment. However, the development of green buildings in many countries is very slow, facing tremendous barriers technologically, culturally, economically and institutionally. How to understand and eliminate these barriers thereby effectively accelerating the development of green buildings presents a significant challenge for both researchers and practitioners. This paper aims to enrich the current efforts in promoting green buildings by proposing conceptual frameworks from a socio-technical transition perspective. The conceptual frameworks provide guidelines for analysing (1) factors affecting the socio-technical transition towards green buildings; (2) the transition phases towards green buildings; and (3) the actions of systemic changes to promote green buildings. The frameworks holistically demonstrate the complexity, struggles and potential strategies to effectively promote green buildings, which could offer references for policymakers, researchers and practitioners involved in green building development.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "What room, if any, does Kant\u2019s philosophy leave for theology? Having denied the proofs for the existence of God, is rational belief in God possible? Within a Kantian framework, can the idea of God ever rise above an empty postulate meant to stabilize practical reason? Can Kant\u2019s God ever reveal himself, act on the world by miracle, or extend moral assistance (grace) to moral agents? If so, can a rational agent ever know that God has done so? Or must such possibilities, if they are possibilities, remain of no practical value to rational beings? Does revealed religion or historical faith offer anything to rational agents that cannot be found within the limits of reason alone? Well into the twentieth century, the most common portraits of Kant answer the preceding questions in a manner bordering on, if not outright accepting, nonrealism. In such portrayals, the \u201call-crushing Kant,\u201d as Moses Mendelssohn dubs him, destroyed traditional metaphysics and thus shut the doors to dogmatic theology with his Critique of Pure Reason. Yet, after undermining the proofs for God and all traditional uses of the idea, Kant finds certain instabilities in reason - particularly in practical reason - as his philosophical program develops. He thus postulates God and immortality to stabilize reason\u2019s moral commitments, but these postulates are far from dogmatic confidence that such postulates exist, and after the postulates have done their job in support of practical reason, they are best forgotten. The most pessimistic renderings of this portrait go so far as naming Kant\u2019s deity \u201cLampe\u2019s God,\u201d in honor of Kant\u2019s manservant and in dishonor of Kant\u2019s God, as if Kant introduced God only to settle the mind of Lampe, who was troubled by the demise of God in the Critique of Pure Reason. A shift began in Kant studies with the publication of Allen Wood\u2019s Kant\u2019s Moral Religion (1971) and Michel Despland\u2019s Kant on History and Religion (1973). These works marked the beginning of a revisitation of Kant\u2019s philosophy of religion, which offered a more robust interpretation of Kantian theology. Wood argues that Kant\u2019s practical philosophy leads toward an absurdum practicum that only religion - and specifically divine grace and forgiveness - can resolve.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Background: Community-dwelling consumers of healthcare are increasing, many aging with life-limiting conditions and deteriorating cognition. However, few have had advance care planning discussions or completed documentation to ensure future care preferences are acted upon. This study examines the awareness, attitudes, and experiences of advance care planning amongst older people and unrelated offspring/caregivers of older people residing in the community. Methods: Qualitative descriptive research, which included focus groups with older people (55+ years) and older people\u2019s offspring/caregivers living in an Australian city and surrounding rural region. Data was analysed using an inductive and comparative approach. Sampling was both convenience and purposive. Participants responded to web-based, newsletter or email invitations from an agency, which aims to support healthcare consumers, a dementia support group, or community health centres in areas with high proportions of culturally and linguistically diverse community-dwellers. Results: Eight focus groups were attended by a homogenous sample of 15 older people and 27 offspring/caregivers, with 43% born overseas. The overarching theme, \u2018shades of grey\u2019: struggles in transition, reflects challenges faced by older people and their offspring/caregivers as older people often erratically transition from independence and capacity to dependence and/or incapacity. Offspring/caregivers regularly struggled with older people\u2019s fluctuating autonomy and dependency as older people endeavoured to remain at home, and with conceptualising \u201cbest times\u201d to actualise advance care planning with substitute decision maker involvement. Advance care planning was supported and welcomed, x advance care planning literacy was evident. Difficulties planning for hypothetical health events and socio-cultural attitudes thwarting death-related discussions were emphasised. Occasional offspring/caregivers with previous substitute decision maker experience reported distress related to their decisions. Conclusions: Advance care planning programs traditionally assume participants are \u2018planning ready\u2019 to legally appoint a substitute decision maker (power of attorney) and record end-of-life treatment preferences in short time frames. This contrasts with how community dwelling older people and offspring/caregivers conceive future care decisions over time. Advance care planning programs need to include provision of information, which supports older people\u2019s advance care planning understanding and management, and also supports offspring/caregivers\u2019 development of strategies for broaching advance care planning with older people, and preparing for potential substitute decision maker roles. Development and integration of strategies to support older people\u2019s decision-making when in the \u2018grey zone\u2019, with fluctuating cognitive capacities, needs further consideration. Findings support an advance care planning model with conversations occurring at key points across a person\u2019s lifespan.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "This study was carried out as part of the packaging optimization program in Norway, and the purpose was to study waste generation, energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG)-emissions from the whole product value chain of meals prepared from fresh ingredients at home, based in semi-prepared ingredients or as ready to eat meals. Consumer attitudes to ready to eat meals was also included in the study. The study was done with basis in Life Cycle Assessment methodologies and Material Flow Analyses, based in real cooking situations and experimental design. Portion sizes and left-overs from cooking and eating data are based in the experimental design. Food waste data from the retail sector is based in the Norwegian statistics from the ForMat project, whereas packaging data was measured from the used products. The consumer study was done through a standard web panel with 1000 respondents, with respondents representative for the Norwegian population. Reallocation of impacts from wasting of food to the place waste is generated has been applied combined with conventional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods. We found that ready to eat meals had higher energy consumption and GHG-emissions than meals prepared from fresh ingredients, which again had slightly higher energy consumption and GHG-emissions than semi-prepared ingredients. Production of ingredients (especially meat) was the most important element for all products. Main contributions to the differences between the dinner types were the use stage, packaging production and transport based in conventional LCA allocation. The effect of food wasting was best shown with the reallocation method, where the impact of total food waste was on the same level as impacts from the use stage. Preventing food waste from retail and use stages would contribute to 13% reduction in GHG-emissions. Ready made food generated more food waste in the retail sector, whereas food waste by consumers was lower than for the two other types of meals. Lower degree of filling contributed to more transport work and higher emissions and energy consumption from transport. More packaging, especially plastic packaging did also contribute to higher GHG-emissions from incineration compared to the other solutions. Consumers regarded packaging solutions from ready to eat meals to be too big and with materials that are difficult to recycle. Changing from only using traditional dinner meal based on fresh ingredients to only ready to eat dinner by a Norwegian household equals GHG-emissions from a standard car driving 900 km or 8% of the average total driving distance per year in Norway.",

We use publically available national datasets to develop an integrated approach for estimating GHG emissions at the metropolitan level over time, between multiple locations, and across sectors. We estimate consistent production-based GHG emissions for the 100 most populated metropolitan areas in the United States in 2014. We find that total 2014 metropolitan CO2 emissions range from 4.1 million metric tons in Lancaster, Pennsylvania to nearly 170 million metric tons in the Houston, Texas; with an overall average of 27 million metric tons. The top 20 absolute emitters and top 20 per capita emitters only overlap for 9 locations. Per capita emissions also show a wide variation: from 5 metric tons per person in the Tucson, Arizona to 65 metric tons per person in the Baton Rouge, Louisiana; with an overall average of 14 metric tons per person. We also compute estimates for 2002 and 2011 and compare to our 2014 emission estimates. Across all locations analyzed, average total emissions increased by 3% and average per capita emissions decreased by 14%. Where possible, we also compare our emission estimates to those reported by the cities in their climate action plans and find an average absolute difference between our estimates and those reported by the cities of 5.6 metric tons CO2 per person, likely due to temporal and scope differences between the two estimates. Our integrated emission estimation approach complements bottom-up approaches typically employed by municipalities and helps practitioners divert their attention and resources away from continuous emission accounting toward more impactful emission mitigation efforts.",

However, it remains uncertain how the projected future changes in ENSO under greenhouse warming will affect TC activity, apart from an expectation that the overall frequency of TCs is likely to decrease for most ocean basins. Here we show robust changes in ENSO-driven variability in TC occurrence by the late twenty-first century. In particular, we show that TCs become more frequent (\u00e2 1/420-40%) during future-climate El Ni\u00f1o events compared with present-climate El Ni\u00f1o events - and less frequent during future-climate La Ni\u00f1a events - around a group of small island nations (for example, Fiji, Vanuatu, Marshall Islands and Hawaii) in the Pacific. We examine TCs across 20 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 database, forced under historical and greenhouse warming conditions. The 12 most realistic models identified show a strong consensus on El Ni\u00f1o-driven changes in future-climate large-scale environmental conditions that modulate development of TCs over the off-equatorial western Pacific and the central North Pacific regions. These results have important implications for climate change and adaptation pathways for the vulnerable Pacific island nations.",

These characteristics are consistent with Curvularia lunata (Wakker) Boedijn (Manamgoda et al. 2012). DNA was extracted from two isolates (ZW4-1 and ZW4-2) and the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were amplified using the primers ITS1 and ITS4 (White et al. 1990), gpd1 and gpd2 (Berbee et al. 1999), respectively. The ITS (accession nos. KX685659 and KX685658) and GAPDH (KX885226 and KX885227) sequences were submitted to GenBank. BLASTn analyses showed the sequences shared 99% similarity with published ITS (JX256429 and JX256430) and GAPHD (JX276441 and JX276442) sequences of C. lunata ex-types, respectively. To confirm pathogenicity, isolates ZW4-1 and ZW4-2 were used to inoculate on A. compressus planted in 10-cm pots by spraying 20 ml conidial suspension (1 \u00d7 106 conidia/ml) with a high-pressure sprayer. Control pots were sprayed with distilled water alone. To maintain high humidity, all plots was covered with a plastic bag and maintained in a growth chamber at 28\u00b0C with a 12-h photoperiod. Foliar lesions developed on plants 1 week post inoculation, similar to those observed on naturally infected plants. No symptoms were observed on control plants. C. lunata was reisolated from the symptomatic leaves, confirming Koch\u2019s postulates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of leaf spot caused by C. lunata on A. compressu in China.",

    "title": "Land management strategies for improving water quality in biomass production under changing climate",
    "abstract_cleaned": "The Corn Belt states are the largest corn-production areas in the United States because of their fertile land and ideal climate. This attribute is particularly important as the region also plays a key role in the production of bioenergy feedstock. This study focuses on potential change in streamflow, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus due to climate change and land management practices in the South Fork Iowa River (SFIR) watershed, Iowa. The watershed is covered primarily with annual crops (corn and soybeans). With cropland conversion to switchgrass, stover harvest, and implementation of best management practices (BMPs) (such as establishing riparian buffers and applying cover crops), significant reductions in nutrients were observed in the SFIR watershed under historical climate and future climate scenarios. Under a historical climate scenario, suspended sediment (SS), total nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) at the outlet point of the SFIR watershed could decrease by up to 56.7%, 32.0%, and 16.5%, respectively, compared with current land use when a portion of the cropland is converted to switchgrass and a cover crop is in place. Climate change could cause increases of 9.7% in SS, 4.1% in N, and 7.2% in P compared to current land use. Under future climate scenarios, nutrients including SS, N, and P were reduced through land management and practices and BMPs by up to 54.0% (SS), 30.4% (N), and 7.1% (P). Water footprint analysis further revealed changes in green water that are highly dependent on land management scenarios. The study highlights the versatile approaches in landscape management that are available to address climate change adaptation and acknowledged the complex nature of different perspectives in water sustainability. Further study involving implementing landscape design and management by using long-term monitoring data from field to watershed is necessary to verify the findings and move toward watershed-specific regional programs for climate adaptation.",

The socio-economic dynamics of such region is an interesting field for research, mainly because: It is a major manufacturing hub with growing importance in retail; it experienced a huge economical shift in the last ten years causing the growth of the middle class (an increase of 50 million people); family firms in the region are the main driver of growth and employment. The authors focused the analysis on Mexico due to its singular characteristics, making it a representative example of the region. Based on secondary sources, a characterization of the entrepreneurship and innovation in family owned and managed firms in the region is reviewed. Moreover, based on the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor database, the authors present some recent data related with entrepreneurship levels in the region and its impact in terms of innovation. Finally, public policy implications are provided in order to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation in family businesses.",

    "title": "Effect of adding variables on rotational ambiguity in positive matrix factorization solutions",
    "abstract_cleaned": "A major problem that limit the use of the model-free analysis methods, like positive matrix factorization (PMF), for the resolution of multivariate data is that usually, there is rotational ambiguity in the results. Implementing adequate constraints may reduce such ambiguities. In some special cases, non-negativity constraints may serve as a sufficient condition to uniquely resolve profiles. In this study, effect of adding new variables on the extent of rotational ambiguity is investigated, and profiles with lower rotation have been obtained on the basis of data set structure. The displacement (DISP) method of error estimation (EE) for the factor elements incorporated into the US Environmental Protection Agency's version of positive matrix factorization (PMF) has been applied to capture the uncertainty of PMF analyses due to rotational ambiguity. To explore these considerations, results are presented for synthetic including submicron particle size distributions (12\u2013470 nm) measured between January 2008 and December 2010 at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYS DEC) site in Rochester, NY. Generally, added informative variables can reduce the ambiguity in the profiles. The results of the PMF analysis showed the effect of adding new variables to feasible solutions led to significantly decreased (up to 44%) DISP intervals. More robust results with lower rotational uncertainty became possible and the results were more easily interpreted. This approach can be applied to any other field that utilize quantitative factor analysis methods.",

    "title": "Review and prospect of the emergency management of urban rainstorm waterlogging based on big data fusion",
    "abstract_cleaned": "The frequent occurrence of urban rainstorm waterlogging is a severe challenge for China's rapid urbanization, which demands prompt countermeasures. However, the fact is that the meteorological data, disaster data, and socio-economic data about rainstorm waterlogging have not been fused effectively at present, which makes it difficult to make emergency response plans in a quick and effective manner and thus hinders the emergency management. The emergency management of urban rainstorm waterlogging is a typical problem of multi-disciplines and big data, involved with meteorology, geography, information science, city planning, economics, management science and other disciplines. The great mass of related data possess rich resources, such as meteorological data, urban waterlogging data, socio-economic data, etc. As these data come from such different departments as water conservancy, meteorology, urban management, operators and Internet, with incompatible temporal and spatial scales as well as non-uniform format standards, thus bringing a huge obstacle to emergency decisions. Therefore, how to achieve the integration of the big data of disasters has become an urgent key issue. In the context of big data, urban rainstorm waterlogging ontology should be constructed in the first place, and then multi-source heterogeneous data should be effectively fused, big data dimension reduced and socio-economic losses assessed. Based on that, an emergency decision can be quickly formed with the help of expert decisions. This is concerned with such contents as large data ontology technology, data fusion methods, data dimension reduction and disaster identification, socio-economic loss assessment of disasters as well as the formation and evaluation of emergency responses. This paper, proceeding from the five parts of the big data fusion of urban rainstorm waterlogging, reviews such theoretical and practical development as ontology technology, data fusion method, data dimension reduction, disaster identification, socio-economic loss assessment of disasters, as well as the drawing up and assessment method of emergency response plans. Generally speaking, China is in urgent need of multi-disciplinary integration to collectively tackle critical problems. Future studies can be carried out in the following ways: First, design big data standard system of urban rainstorm waterlogging, so as to realize the semantic annotation of city waterlogging. Second, conduct in-depth researches on such three aspects as grid non-spatial attribute data, unified spatial coordinate system, together with the general algorithm of soft and hard data fusion, in order to solve the problems of the consistency and association between soft data and hard data. Third, extract complex changes in urban rainstorm waterlogging from multifarious data, so as to realize the dimension reduction of high dimensional data and the recognition of urban rainstorm waterlogging. Fourth, construct the risk database of urban rainstorm waterlogging disasters and assess the economic impacts of typical urban waterlogging on related regions, industries and departments, in order to provide data and scenario support for the emergency management of urban rainstorm waterlogging. Fifth, based on the fusion platform of meteorological data, urban waterlogging data and socio-economic data, by means of case-based reasoning (CBR), rule-based reasoning (RBR) and geographic information system (GIS), generate emergency response plans, and then evaluate and adjust them according to the scenario changes. Finally, what is pointed out is that the research should be carried out on the emergency management of urban waterlogging in the context of big data fusion, which can enrich the theories and methods of the emergency management of urban rainstorm waterlogging and set a typical example for the innovative exploration of the paradigm changes in big-data-driven management decisions, and for the multi-disciplinary development of management science, economics, meteorology and information science.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Children's literacy skills in schools and at home are widely supported by technologies designed to advance their development. Surprisingly, the unique effects of specific interface features are widely disputed and inconsistent research findings make it challenging to generalise across different technologies. It is difficult to make an informed choice about which types of e-books, and which specific features, are most effective. This small-scale, experimental study examines the effects of specific interface features and compares them to a Flat e-book. In a pre- and post-test comparison design, we investigated the effects of three different e-book conditions (1) \u2018Flat\u2019 e-book, (2) \u2018E-friend\u2019, and (3) \u2018Dictionary\u2019. Ninety typically developing Year-1 readers were selected from nine primary schools in England and then randomly assigned to one of the experimental groups. Results showed that children in the \u2018Dictionary\u2019 group increased more in Word Recognition of target words compared to the children in the \u2018E-friend\u2019 group. However, children in the \u2018E-friend\u2019 group made significantly greater gains in Reading Comprehension than children in the \u2018Dictionary\u2019 group. Children in the \u2018Flat e-book\u2019 performed as well on all measures as children in the enhanced features groups. We suggest new directions for research on features that might be superior to Flat e-books.",

First, a novel variable-interval reference signal optimization approach and a fuzzy control-based charging/discharging scheme are presented to smooth wind power, maintaining the state-of-health of BESS in the meanwhile. And then, power and energy capacities are determined according to a statistical model of charge/discharge power and the economic cost model, respectively. Finally, case studies are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The impact from wind power forecasting error during real-time operation is also analyzed.",

Higher mixing ratio of O3 was observed for wind blowing from the sea, which indicates that the coastal air mass might carry more O3. A decreasing trend in O3 levels was observed from weekdays to weekends at all the three sites. As to the spatial variation, higher levels of O3 were observed at the suburban and rural sites where less O3 was depleted by NO titration. In contrast, the urban site exhibited lower O3 but higher NOx levels due to the influence of traffic emissions. Larger amplitudes of diurnal and monthly O3 variations were observed at the suburban site than those at the urban and rural sites. In general, the O3 levels at the non-urban sites were more affected by the background transport, while both the local and regional contributions played roles in urban O3 variations. The annual average O3 mixing ratios (22.7\u201337.7 ppb) in Ningbo were generally similar to those of other regions around the world. However, the recommended air quality standards for O3 were often exceeded during warm seasons, which could be a potential threat to both local population and plant growth.",

Existing theory points out that if a country\u2019s policies do not make provision for sufficient own-revenue sources like provincial taxes and levies for provincial governments, citizens may hold the national government, to whom they pay their taxes, accountable. Based on a case study in the Northern Cape Provincial Government, this article suggests that provincial governments in South Africa are unable to collect enough own-revenue, making them dependent on transfers from national government to deliver goods and services to their citizens. The results confirm the theoretical perspective that accountability is undermined, as it is not always possible for taxpayers to directly link the governing unit responsible for the service to its funding. This is relevant because provincial governments are responsible for important services, and they spend taxpayers\u2019 money collected mainly by national government to deliver these services.",

The research questions of interest were: (a) What is the mixed-gender, mixed-caseload model of shelter-based service provision to CSEC and other youth in need of rehabilitative programming?; (b) What was the rationale for using this approach?; and (c) What have been the successes and challenges of changing to a mixed-gender, mixed-caseload shelter model? This study is exploratory and the actual model has not yet been evaluated, so it would be premature to suggest that there are clear clinical implications from this case study. For future researchers, aspects of the service provision model may be of clinical interest to other European providers and providers in other nations. Mixed-gender shelter models for youth in need of services may be worth considering, trying, and evaluating.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Aims: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of severe coronary artery calcification (CAC) is challenging. The ORBIT II study demonstrated the safety and efficacy of orbital atherectomy (OA) in patients with severe CAC. Microparticulate liberated during OA may disturb the coronary microcirculation. In the present study, we evaluated OA treatment in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Methods and results: Patients were grouped by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): 26-40% (n=33), 41-50% (n=90), and >50% (n=314). Procedural success was similar (LVEF 26-40%: 90.9%, LVEF 41-50%: 88.9%, LVEF >50%: 88.4%). Rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularisation, were similar in the LVEF 26-40%, 41-50%, and >50% groups, respectively, at 30 days (9.1%, 7.8%, 11.5%) and one year (18.2%, 19.1%, 16.0%). Although the 30-day cardiac death rate was 0% in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, one-year cardiac death was higher compared with patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function. Conclusions: No patient with left ventricular systolic dysfunction experienced cardiac death at 30 days suggesting that OA was well tolerated without haemodynamic complication. However, one-year cardiac death was higher in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, consistent with previous studies demonstrating the association between reduced left ventricular function and increased mortality after PCI.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "A general equilibrium macroeconomic model is used to study the equivalence of export subsidies and import tariff reductions in increasing export output. It is shown that the qualitative effects of both policies are the same; an import tariff reduction is an equally viable alternative for expanding exports. It is also seen that in a typical developing economy with a large nontradable goods sector, the import tariff reduction may well be a better choice in this regard. Hence, when striving for export expansion, developing countries and emerging market nations cannot afford to be lackadaisical in liberalizing imports. This observation may be also related to the argument that it is not possible to nurture a small pocket of advanced export industry in an economy shaded from competition and characterized by inefficiency and low productivity.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The impact of thermal imprinting on the plasticity of the hypothalamic-pituitary- interrenal (HPI) axis and stress response in an adult ectotherm, the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata, L.), during its development was assessed. Fish were reared under 4 thermal regimes, and the resulting adults exposed to acute confinement stress and plasma cortisol levels and genes of the HPI axis were monitored. Changes in immune function, a common result of stress, were also evaluated using histomorphometric measurements of melanomacrophages centers (MMCs) in the head kidney and by monitoring macrophage-related transcripts. Thermal history significantly modified the HPI responsiveness in adult sea bream when eggs and larvae were reared at a higher than optimal temperature (HT, 22\u00b0C), and they had a reduced amplitude in their cortisol response and significantly upregulated pituitary pomc and head kidney star transcripts. Additionally, after an acute stress challenge, immune function was modified and the head kidney of adult fish reared during development at high temperatures (HT and LHT, 18-22\u00b0C) had a decreased number of MMCs and a significant downregulation of dopachrome tautomerase. Thermal imprinting during development influenced adult sea bream physiology and increased plasma levels of glucose and sodium even in the absence of an acute stress in fish reared under a high-low thermal regime (HLT, 22-18\u00b0C). Overall, the results demonstrate that temperature during early development influences the adult HPI axis and immune function in a teleost fish.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The harlequin ladybird, Harmonia axyridis, is an important natural enemy of aphids throughout the world, but is now also considered an invasive alien species. We performed a meta-analysis of published life history data to address the question whether invading populations in Europe and North America have life history parameters that differ from native populations in Asia, explaining the beetle\u2019s invasion success in new territories. In this meta-analysis, we accounted for important covariables that are often reported in published studies such as temperature, food source (aphids or eggs of Ephestia kuehniella), strain (laboratory or field populations) and photoperiod. Temperature was a key factor having consistent large effects on development rate, survival and reproductive characteristics of H. axyridis. Food source, strain, and photoperiod had effects on some, but not all characteristics, and their overall effect across characteristics was minor. Individuals of invasive populations had a shorter pre-oviposition period and higher fecundity at low temperatures than those of native populations, and a greater longevity across all temperatures. No differences in survival were found between native and invasive populations, while differences in development rate were not consistent, with opposing results obtained according to the way development rate was measured in trials reported in the literature. Results of this meta-analysis support the hypothesis that the life history of the beetle has changed during its invasion into North America and Europe. Invasive populations had a shorter pre-oviposition period and higher fecundity at low temperatures, as well as a greater longevity across all temperatures than native populations. These differences may partially explain the invasive success of H. axyridis.",

Predicted probabilities were also computed to observe the net differences in the likelihood of both the first and the required number of antenatal care (ANC) visits for each of the three analysis years. Women in Nigeria were 7% less likely in 2008 compared to 2003, and in Malawi, 32% more likely in 2013 compared to 2000, to utilise ANC in the first trimester of pregnancy. Timing of first ANC visit was strongly influenced by wealth in Nigeria but not in Malawi. The findings in our case studies show how various contextual factors may enable or inhibit policy performance. Maternal and child health, SDGs should incorporate both wealth and degrees of urbanicity into country level implementation strategies.",

The optimal capacity and operation strategy in two different scenarios were compared, and a ratio of feed-in tariff to electricity purchasing price was introduced to study the economic performances, which can help the government to make incentive policy on feed-in tariff to promote the development of CCHP system. Six assessment criteria were calculated and compared in different scenarios with various single-objectives. Furthermore, a pareto frontier was used to illustrate the multi-objective optimization. The results showed that the ratio of feed-in tariff to electricity purchasing price need to be at least greater than 0.5 in order to produce more benefits by utilizing CCHP system. Moreover, the weight coefficient of economic factor which is generally in the range of 0.6 to 1 had a significant influence on the capacity of prime mover and carbon dioxide emission of CCHP system.",

The organic compounds are ionized or oxidized by direct electrolysis on the anode in the electrolytic cell of the electro-Fenton process. The effects of operating parameters such as concentrations of Fe2+ and H2O2, pH, and current density on chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal were determined. The degradation of the TFT-LCD wastewater was faster by the electro-Fenton process than the conventional Fenton process. The highest COD removal efficiency was 100% at 120 min; pH=4; [Fe2+]=3.5 mM; [H2O2]=285 mM; and 1.5 A/dm2 of current density.

    "abstract_cleaned": "With the majority of the world's human population now living in cities, urban forests provide an increasingly important range of ecosystem services, from improved air quality and climate change adaptation to better public health outcomes and increased tourism revenues. The importance of these ecosystem services in urban environments, and the central role that cities play in the lives of people around the world, have motivated various attempts to quantify the value of ecosystem services provided by urban forests. This paper reviews existing research in the fields of urban forestry, economics, sociology, and health on the value of urban ecosystem services, with a focus on cultural services, a category of ecosystem services that is of key importance to human well-being but that has suffered from a lack of empirical research. The review identified 38 studies that examined the value of mixed vegetation, 31 studies that examined the value of trees, and 43 studies that examined the value of green spaces. Psychological health is the most-studied ecosystem service category, with most research in this area focusing on the services of mixed vegetation. Social health, community economic development, and tourism are the least-studied, with most research in these areas focusing on mixed vegetation and trees. Multiple metrics were used to quantify the value of urban greenery within each ecosystem service category but only 11 metrics were assigned a monetary value. Gaps in the literature that present strong opportunities for future research include: the value of urban forests for improving social health, equitable access to ecosystem services, the impact of urban forests on community economic development, and economic valuation and green exposure metrics. We hope that this review stimulates future research in the areas highlighted and that municipalities consider including evaluations of a broad range of ecosystem services during land use planning and budgeting processes.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "This study aims to analyze the univariate distribution and bivariate distribution characteristics of DBH and height of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica nature forests on sandy land at Honghuaerji of Inner Mongolia of northern China in order to provide scientific basis for their sustainable forest management. Two 1 ha Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica nature forest plots with different densities(940 and 1 149 plant/ha) were established and all trees with DBH >5 cm were investigated. Density distribution characteristics of DBH and height and their bivariate distribution were analyzed on whole stand level and on different categorized tree height size classes, and the statistical calculation was implemented in R language software. The results showed that: 1) on the whole stand level, the distributions of DBH and height of tree in two plots generally showed double-peak curve. The average DBH in plot 1 and plot 2 was basically the same while average height in plot 2 was greater than plot 1, but number of large size class trees both in terms of DBH and height in plot 1 was greater than plot 2. Analysis based on different categorized height layers showed that distributions of DBH and height of overstory trees were unimodal distribution in both plots and distribution of DBH in plot 1 was normal distribution. Average diameter of overstory trees in both plots was basically the same but average height of overstory trees in plot 2 was greater than plot 1, and number of overstory trees in plot 1 was more than plot 2. Additionally, distributions of DBH and height of understory trees in two plots showed unimodal distribution and the distribution of DBH in plot 2 was normal distribution. Average diameters of understory trees in plot 1 and plot 2 were basically the same but average height of understory trees in plot 2 was more than plot 1, and large trees of overstory trees in plot 2 were also more than plot 1. 2) The bivariate distributions of DBH and height in two plots were multi-peak distribution. Overall, the ratio of large tree size class was more than small tree size class in plot 1, but this situation was opposite in plot 2. Meanwhile, the ratio of height to DBH of large tree size class was less than small tree size class in plot 1, but the ratio was almost the same in plot 2. From different height layer analysis, the ratio of large tree size class was more than small tree size class among overstory trees in the two plots, and the ratio of height to DBH of overstory trees was not significantly different between large and small tree size classes. The ratio of large tree size class was greater than small tree size class among understory trees in plot 1, but this situation was opposite in plot 2, and the ratio of height to DBH of large tree size class was less than small tree size class of underwood in the two plots. Stand density had no obvious effect on average diameter in Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica nature forests. High density can elevate the growth of tree height of whole stand, but number of dominant trees of whole stand decreased in high density stand, especially for overstory trees. In the meanwhile, stand density had effect on the distribution of energy in the radial and longitudinal growth of trees, and the biomass was always distributed to tree height growth in the high density stand. Therefore, high density forest should be properly thinned in order to decrease intertree competition, which can allocate tree biomass reasonably and improve the proportion of dominant trees in whole stand. For low density stands, the forest should be taken properly above story thinning in order to improve the growth of understory trees.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Drug stock-outs are an unfortunate yet common reality for patients living in low and middle income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where trouble with consistent stock of antiretroviral medications (ARVs) continues. Our study takes a snapshot of this problem in Ghana. Although the country launched its antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme in 2003, progress toward realising the full benefit of ART for treated individuals has been limited, in part, because of stock-outs. In Ghana's Greater Accra region, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 40 women living with HIV (WLHIV) and 15 individuals with a history of HIV-related work in government or non-governmental organisations, or healthcare facilities. We used repeated review with coding and mapping techniques to analyse the transcripts and identify common themes. Stock-outs of ARVs result in inconsistent administration of therapy, increased indirect medical costs for WLHIV, and negative labelling of patients. Inefficiencies in drug supply, poor coordination with port authorities, inadequate government funding and dependence on international aid contribute to the stock-outs experienced in Ghana. Although using ARVs produced in-country could reduce supply problems, the domestically-manufactured product currently does not meet World Health Organization (WHO) standards. We recommend focused efforts to produce WHO standard ARVs in Ghana, and a review of current supply chain management to identify and mend pitfalls in the system.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The morphological and chemical properties of homegardens in the beach ridges with interspersed swales (BRIS) soils were evaluated in order to find a clue for developing sustainable agricultural management. Field survey and soil sampling were conducted at the homegardens and secondary forests in Sungai Ular Village and in the experimental farm of Malaysian Agriculture Research Institute (MARDI), Cherating Station. Chemical fertilizers including ash, charcoal waste and plant litter were applied to the homegardens in both the inland-ward area (HG-I) and in the shoreline area (HG-S). Manure was applied in HG-I and seafood waste from fish processing was buried in the soils in HG-S. High correlation was found between total carbon (T-C) and cation exchange capacity (CEC), indicating soil organic matter was the determinant factor for CEC in the very sandy BRIS soils. The levels of T-C, total nitrogen (T-N), and CEC at 0\u201310 cm in HG-I in parallel with increasing ages of homegardens. The soils in 0\u201310 cm and 20\u201330 cm showed higher levels of T-C and T-N with higher C/N ratios in HG-I than in HG-S and the MARDI farm. The high levels of exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K in HG-I compared with the MARDI farm, suggesting that improved CEC with increasing soil organic matter in HG-I heighten the retention of basic cations supplied as chemical fertilizer, ash, and manure. The level of available P was higher in HG-S than HG-I, attributed by the seafood waste application in the shoreline area. Thus, on the BRIS, the levels of soil organic matter and nutrients can be sustained by the homegarden management although it cannot be regarded as a closed system compared with those in the other tropical regions because chemical fertilizer was used and a certain amounts of nutrients seemed to leach down beyond plant rooting depth.",

Drawing on notions of contests for power in regulatory space, we show how a policy coalition of egg industry and government primary industries actors successfully advocated for \u201cfree range\u201d to be legally defined in a new consumer law information standard in accordance with existing, industrial-scale free range production systems, rather than the smaller scale systems preferred by consumer and animal welfare advocates. While this decision reflects the traditional regulatory capture by agricultural industries of Australian food and animal welfare policy decision making, we suggest that it equally reflects the existing power structure in the retail egg market \u2013 namely the two major supermarkets\u2019 adoption of industrial free range as their own standard for higher welfare egg labelling.",

    "title": "Farmer behavior and perceptions to alternative scenarios in a highly intensive agricultural region, south central China",
    "abstract_cleaned": "VAbstract Intensive agriculture has caused unintended environmental consequences, such as water quality degradation. It is necessary for policymakers to make proper planning of sustainable agricultural development. Using a Pressure-State-Response (PSR) framework, we conducted surveys focused on farmer behavior toward agriculture and environmental protection in 2009 and 2011. The surveys indicated that farmer behavior was complex and contradictory, and caused some environmental effects. Therefore, we used normative landscape scenario method to develop two scenarios. Both scenarios emphasized on stable economic growth along with water quality improvement and presented good effects. A feedback survey was organized in 2013 to interpret farmers' perceptions of the alternative scenarios. The results indicate Scenario I is likely to be accepted by farmers; however, the beautiful rural landscape in Scenario II represents what farmers want, and Scenario I or II can be achieved by changing farm behavior in the future. By logistic regression model analysis, increasing agriculture benefits and new technology popularization were key factors affecting farmer behavior. Relevant policy implications on farmers were proposed. This paper showed how important to understand farmer behavior and perceptions to agricultural development, and a description of the alternative scenarios and policy implications are meaningful for policymakers to manage nature resources.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Background: The classical phenotype, accumulated deficit model and self-report approach of frailty were found not useful in older adults in northwest Russia. More research is needed to identify predictors of adverse outcomes in this population. Aim: The aim of this study is to identify predictors of mortality, autonomy and cognitive decline in a population that is characterized by a high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rate. Methods: A population-based prospective cohort study of 611 community-dwelling individuals 65+. Anthropometry, medical history nutritional status were recorded. An evaluation of cognitive, physical and autonomy function, spirometry, and laboratory tests were performed. The total follow-up was 5 years. Multiple imputation, backward stepwise Cox regression analysis, C-statistic, risk reclassification analysis and the bootstrapping techniques were used to analyze the data. Results: We found that the combination of increasing age, male sex, low physical function, low mid-arm muscle area, low forced expiratory volume in 1 s and anemia was associated with mortality for people 65+. The substitution of anemia with anemia + high level of C-reactive protein (hCRP) and the addition of high brain natriuretic peptide (hBNP) levels improved the classification of older persons at risk for mortality. Discussion/conclusion: The combination of low physical function, low mid-arm muscle area, low forced expiratory volume in 1 s, anemia with hCRP levels and hBNP identified older persons at a higher risk for mortality. These predictors may be used for the development of a prediction model to detect older people who are at risk for adverse health outcomes in northwest Russia.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Purpose of review The article reviews the reality of anesthetic resource constraints in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Understanding these limitations is important to volunteers from high-income countries who desire to teach or safely provide anesthesia services in these countries. Recent findings Recently published information on the state of anesthetic resources in LMICs is helping to guide humanitarian outreach efforts from high-income countries. The importance of using context-appropriate anesthesia standards and equipment is now emphasized. Global health experts are encouraging equal partnerships between anesthesia health care providers working together from different countries. The key roles that ketamine and regional anesthesia play in providing well tolerated anesthesia for cesarean sections and other common procedures is increasingly recognized. Summary Anesthesia can be safely given in LMICs with basic supplies and equipment, if the anesthesia provider is trained and vigilant. Neuraxial and regional anesthesia and the use of ketamine as a general anesthetic appear to be the safest alternatives in low-resource countries. Environmentally appropriate equipment should be encouraged and pulse oximeters should be in every anesthetizing location. LMICs will continue to need support from outside sources until capacity building has made more progress.",

Current velocity did not exceed 24 cm/s and the wave field alternated between calm and moderate conditions (maximum wave height of 3.5 m). Legs on the longline maintained the mainline between 10 and 12.5 m above the seabed (around 10 m below the surface). The loading and motion of the longline were relatively small. Tension in the mooring lines (semi-hourly averaged maximum of 580 N) was limited by the combined effect of a small pretension, current shielding between mussel droppers, flow blockage by surrounding longlines and leg resistance. Significant longline displacement occurred only during short periods of time when the predicted drag force transmitted to the legs exceeded their predicted holding capacity. Mussel dropper vertical acceleration (maximum of 1/20 g) was limited by the exponential attenuation of wave loading with depth.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The aim of this paper is to contribute to debates about how governments and other stakeholders can influence the application of ICTs to increase access to safe, effective and affordable treatment of common illnesses, especially by the poor. First, it argues that the health sector is best conceptualized as a 'knowledge economy'. This supports a broadened view of health service provision that includes formal and informal arrangements for the provision of medical advice and drugs. This is particularly important in countries with a pluralistic health system, with relatively underdeveloped institutional arrangements. It then argues that reframing the health sector as a knowledge economy allows us to circumvent the blind spots associated with donor-driven ICT-interventions and consider more broadly the forces that are driving e-health innovations. It draws on small case studies in Bangladesh and China to illustrate new types of organization and new kinds of relationship between organizations that are emerging. It argues that several factors have impeded the rapid diffusion of ICT innovations at scale including: the limited capacity of innovations to meet health service needs, the time it takes to build new kinds of partnership between public and private actors and participants in the health and communications sectors and the lack of a supportive regulatory environment. It emphasises the need to understand the political economy of the digital health knowledge economy and the new regulatory challenges likely to emerge. It concludes that governments will need to play a more active role to facilitate the diffusion of beneficial ICT innovations at scale and ensure that the overall pattern of health system development meets the needs of the population, including the poor.",

In the case of Cuenca, a World Heritage City, a maintenance campaign in the traditional neighborhood of San Roque was carried out in 2014. The objective was to undertake maintenance actions on roofs and fa\u00e7ades as well as on elements at risk. The campaign process was developed keeping in mind the cycle or phases of preventive conservation: anamnesis, diagnosis, therapy and control (ICOMOS, 2003). At the end of the maintenance campaign an impact assessment was undertaken and monitoring tools were handed out to the community in order to strengthen the citizen participation in the preservation of built heritage. The experience of the maintenance campaign unveiled a series of lessons that have been evaluated in the present investigation, being the main objective the strengthening of the processes of governance and documentation through the formulation of strategies inherent to the maintenance of heritage buildings. In this process it is shown that the participation of citizens is a strategic factor for the sustainable development of maintenance campaigns, which allow for the preservation of historical sites for future generations.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "This study investigates effects of fixed film surface area increment on removal efficacy and biofouling in membrane bioreactor (MBR). For this purpose, a lab-scale membrane bioreactor was used. Domestic wastewater was fed into it. Three different trials were conducted at different fluxes; 15, 20, and 25 L/m2/h (LMH). Every trial was conducted using four different scenarios by varying surface area of fixed media viz. 0, 100, 150, and 200 m2/m3. Removal of pollutants viz. chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total organic content (TOC), total Khjdel nitrogen (TKN), and phosphorous was studied. In addition, cake resistance, pore resistance, and total resistance were also observed for aforementioned scenarios. The results demonstrated that pollutant removal efficiencies increased as the surface area per unit volume of bioreactor was increased. Conversely, the removal efficiency decreased with increase in the fluxes. In the case of biofouling, it increased while increasing the surface area or flux. The fixed media surface area increments proved beneficial in terms of removal efficiencies but at the cost of reduced operation time of MBR.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "At a time when there is a growing discussion about the natural state of estuaries, a comparison of macrozoobenthos communities from two surveys conducted 30 years apart in the Ems Dollard estuary, in the eastern Wadden Sea, The Netherlands, provides a unique opportunity to compare changes over time. As expected, our comparison revealed a gradient in species composition from land (the Dollard) to sea (the Outer Ems) at both points in time, with brackish species in the Dollard and more marine species in the Outer Ems (Wadden Sea). Total richness increased over time; however, this mainly reflected the immigration of new species and sampling differences. In the Dollard, total biomass declined over time, most likely reflecting de-eutrophication in this area. Strikingly, at the meeting point between the sea and the brackish Dollard, i.e. the Inner Ems, the community composition changed from one dominated by bivalves (1970s) to one dominated by worms (since 2009). This change involved a reduction in total biomass, mainly of Mya arenaria, and immigration of polychaete worms (Marenzellaria viridis and Alitta succinea). In the Outer Ems, an increase in total biomass was observed, associated with the recent successful recruitment of Cerastoderma edule. This comparison highlights that historical data provides useful insights at large spatial scales. However, a full understanding of the complex dynamics of estuaries requires an analysis of continuous long-term monitoring series.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "In India 14 seagrass species can be found with monospecific genera (Enhalus, Thalassia and Syringodium), Cymodocea with two species and Halophila and Halodule represented by more than two taxonomically complex species. Considering this, the present study was made to understand the level and pattern of genetic variability among these species collected from Tamilnadu coast, India. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was used to evaluate the level of polymorphism existing between the species. Out of the 12 primers tested, 10 primers amplified 415 DNA fragments with an average of 41.5 fragments per primer. Of the total 415 amplified fragments only 123 (29.7%) were monomorphic and the remaining 292 (70.3%) were polymorphic for Indian seagrass species. Among the 10 primers used four are identified as the key primers capable of distinguishing all the Indian seagrasses with a high degree of polymorphism and bringing representative polymorphic alleles in all the tested seagrasses. From the present investigation, this study shows that the RAPD marker technique can be used not only as a tool to analyse genetic diversity but also to resolve the taxonomic uncertainties existing in the Indian seagrasses. The efficiency of these primers in bringing out the genetic polymorphism or homogeneity among different populations of the Halophila and Halodule complex still has to be tested before recommending these primers as an identification tool for Indian seagrasses.",

Throughout its history, Mexico City's Historic Centre has served as a site of informal commerce. However, the adoption of neoliberal economic policies and the privatisation of public spaces have produced a paradox. While the number of street vendors rises as options for gainful employment dwindle, the criminalisation of their means of subsistence has exposed these individuals to police bribes, confiscation and harassment. Sounds (e.g., street cries, whistles and coded language) are essential to the maintenance of this tenuous way of life. Sounds are used to lure customers, claim territory and execute highly coordinated evasions of police raids.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Heavy metal pollution has become one of the most significant pollution problems encountered by our country in terms of environment protection. In addition to the significant effects of heavy metals on the human body and other organisms through water, food chain enrichment and other routes, heavy metals involved in daily necessities beyond the level limit could also affect people\u2019s lives, so the detection of heavy metals is extremely important. Ir (III) coordination compound, considered to be one of the best phosphorescent sensing materials, is characterized by high luminous efficiency, easy modification of the ligand and so on, and it has potential applications in the field of heavy metal detection. This project aims to product a new Ir (III) functional coordination compound by designing a new auxiliary ligand and a main ligand with a sulfur identification unit, in order to systematically investigate the application of iridium coordination compound in the detection of the heavy metal Hg2+. With the introduction of the sulfur identification unit, selective sensing of Hg2+ could be achieved. Additionally, a new auxiliary ligand is also introduced to produce a functional iridium coordination compound with high quantum efficiency, and to diversify the application of iridium coordination compound in this field.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "A number of black box and process-based modelling approaches, their strengths/limitations, and future applications for simulating contaminant dynamics in constructed wetlands (CWs) have been reviewed. Scanning of literature reveals that most of the CW modelling approaches are limited to the simulation of only nutrient and organic pollutant load dynamics. Performance analysis of the various process/black box-based models for simulating pollutant dynamics in vertical subsurface flow, horizontal subsurface flow, and hybrid CW systems further reveals that most of the existing modelling approaches have not not so far been able to account for the changing climatic conditions and the heavy metal dynamics. The paper thus highlights the gaps in the knowledge in the current state of the art for simulating wetland pollutant dynamics and suggests mechanisms for increasing the scope of such modelling approaches in the proper design and operation of the CW systems.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "This study investigates the incorporation of open source data into a Bayesian classification of urban land use from very high resolution (VHR) stereo satellite images. The adopted classification framework starts from urban land cover classification, proceeds to building-type characterization, and results in urban land use. For urban land cover classification, a preliminary classification distinguishes trees, grass, and shadow objects using a random forest at a fine segmentation level. Fuzzy decision trees derived from hierarchical Bayesian models separate buildings from other man-made objects at a coarse segmentation level, where an open street map provides prior building information. A Bayesian network classifier combining commonly used land use indicators and spatial arrangement is used for the urban land use classification. The experiments were conducted on GeoEye stereo images over Oklahoma City, USA. Experimental results showed that the urban land use classification using VHR stereo images performed better than that using a monoscopic VHR image, and the integration of open source data improved the final urban land use classification. Our results also show a way of transferring the adopted urban land use classification framework, developed for a specific urban area in China, to other urban areas. The study concludes that incorporating open source data by Bayesian analysis improves urban land use classification. Moreover, a pretrained convolutional neural network fine tuned on the UC Merced land use dataset offers a useful tool to extract additional information for urban land use classification.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "A one-dimensional semi-analytical solution of land-derived solute transport, subject to tidal fluctuation in a coastal confined aquifer, was derived using the generalized integral-transform technique (GITT). To investigate the plume migration of land-derived contaminants within a tidally influenced aquifer, both spatially and temporally varying expressions of the Darcy velocity and dispersion coefficients obtained from the analytical solution of the groundwater head response, which were subject to sinusoidal boundary conditions due to tidal fluctuation, were considered. This new semi-analytical solution was verified against a numerical solution, as well as the peak location trajectory obtained using the Predictor-Corrector method. Sensitivity analyses of tidal amplitude, hydraulic conductivity, and storage coefficient using the proposed solution were performed to understand plume behavior with regard to plume shape, plume spatial moments, and macrodispersion coefficients to gain a better understanding of the transport mechanisms. As the tidal amplitude, hydraulic conductivity, and storage coefficient were increased, the peaks were travelled faster, and peak concentrations were decreased. In addition, an increase in tidal amplitude, hydraulic conductivity, and storage coefficient caused an increase in variance as well as the macrodispersion coefficient. It was observed that negative macrodispersion appeared when the storage coefficient was largest, as well as when the difference between landward-directed advective velocity at the leading and trailing edges of the plume was greatest. This newly developed semi-analytical solution provides a useful mathematical tool for validating numerical models and understanding the physical mechanism of the migration of plume discharge to the sea or estuaries within a tidally influenced aquifer.",

The \u2018Sardinia cold-water coral province\u2019 is characterized in the Nora canyon by a spectacular coral growth dominated by the branching scleractinian Madrepora oculata at a depth of 380\u2013460 m. The general biohermal frame is strengthened by the common occurrence of the solitary scleractinian Desmophyllum dianthus and the occasional presence of Lophelia pertusa. As documented by Remotely Operated Vehicle survey, this area is a hotspot of megafaunal diversity hosting among other also live specimens of the deep oyster Neopycnodonte zibrowii. The new coral province is located between the central Mediterranean CWC provinces (Bari Canyon, Santa Maria di Leuca, South Malta) and the western and northern ones (Melilla, Catalan-Proven\u00e7al-Ligurian canyons). As for all the best developed CWC situations in the present Mediterranean Sea, the new Sardinian province is clearly influenced by Levantine Intermediate Water which appears to be a main driver for CWC distribution and viability in this basin.",

Based on the assessment of the local large insolation, the type of agricultural, biomass and husbandry resources, this study selected the design of anaerobic digestion units processing mostly animal and human waste, and whose heating and power requirement would be entirely provided by solar photovoltaic/thermal to maintain optimum efficiency of the biogas production. The designs was carried out at the scale of up to 15 household demand (community scale). Volume and therefore the production of biogas maybe increased or decreased in the design considered, and local, low cost resilient material were proposed.

Data driven tools as part of new ecosystem can link resources and need to build an effective platform for use during disasters. To accomplish ecosystem coevolution, creating a collaborative system with crowdsourced data, spatial data, and historical data is essential. EventShop is one such tool used to detect and observe changing real-world situations in real-time. Multimedia micro-reports are global, powerful, impactful and spontaneous data streams which are obtained from applications like Krumbs, Twitter, Flickr, etc. These micro-reports assist EventShop in building a rescue system that provides rescue responses to victims during disasters. In this paper, we present a framework that uses EventShop and multimedia micro-reports to correspond with victims during one such disaster, the flood.",

Formation and disintegration of PhT-protein complexes was studied with \u03b2-casein (random coil) and bovine serum albumin (BSA, globular) at various pH. PhT had similar binding affinity for \u03b2-casein and BSA as pentagalloyl glucose, as studied by fluorescence quenching. The affinity of PhT for both proteins was independent of pH (3.0, 6.0, and 8.0). In the presence of PhT, the pH range for precipitation of tannin-protein complexes widened to 0.5-1.5 pH units around the isoelectric point (pI) of the protein. Complete protein resolubilization from insoluble PhT-protein complexes was achieved at pH 7 and 2 for \u03b2-casein and BSA, respectively. It was demonstrated that PhT modulate the solubility of proteins at neutral pH and that resolubilization of PhT-protein complexes at pH deviating from pI is mainly governed by the charge state of the protein.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Background: At the turn of the 90s, studies showed that health research contributed little to health and development in low- and middle-income countries because it was oriented towards international priorities and dominated by researchers from the North. A new approach to North-South collaboration was required that would support demand-driven and locally led research in the South. The aim of this study was to analyse the development and functioning of a programme for demand-driven and locally led research in Ghana that was supported by a North-South collaboration. Methods: For this mixed-method case study, we combined document analysis, key informant interviews and observation of programme events. Results: The development of the research programme started with constructing a sponsorship constellation in the Netherlands. After highlighting the problems with traditional research collaboration, an advisory council formulated a vision for a more equal and effective approach to North-South collaboration. Together with Ghanaian partners, this vision was turned into a proposal for a Ghanaian-led programme for demand-driven and locally led research, which was funded by the Netherlands government. Research priority setting showed that the Ghanaian research needs were very different from the priorities of foreign funders and researchers. After a slow start, the number of locally submitted proposals increased from 13 in 2001 to 94 in 2005, revealing the existence of a substantial, but partly latent reservoir of research capacity. In total, 79 studies were funded. An impact evaluation showed that the results of the majority of the studies were used to contribute to action. Despite its success, the research programme came to an end in 2008 after the sponsorship constellation in the Netherlands fell apart. Conclusion: Our study shows that realising a programme for demand-driven and locally led research in the South provides an effective approach to North-South collaboration in which results are used and local capacities and institutions are strengthened.",

    "title": "Overall bike effectiveness as a sustainability metric for bike sharing systems",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Bike sharing systems (BSS) have been widely accepted as an urban transport scheme in many cities around the world. The concept is recently expanded and followed by many cities to offer citizen a green and flexible transportation scheme in urban areas. Many works focus on the issues of bike availability while the bike performance, i.e., life cycle issues and its sustainability, for better management has been abandoned. As a consequence, mismanagement of BSS would lead to cost inefficiency and, the worst case, end with operation termination. This study proposes a design science approach by developing an Overall Bike Effectiveness (OBE) framework. By incorporating the concept of overall equipment analysis (OEE), the proposed framework is used to measure the bike utilization. Accordingly, the OBE is extended into Theoretical OBE to measure the sustainability of the early-stage of BSS. The framework has been verified and evaluated using a real dataset of BSS. The proposed method provides valuable results for benchmarking, life cycle analysis, system expansion and strategy planning toward sustainability. The paper concludes with a discussion to show the impact of the proposed approach into the real practices of BSS including an outlook toward sustainability of BSS.",

The main aims of this research were: (i) to evaluate two postharvest pre-treatments (nitrogen shock N2 and heat shock) prior controlled atmosphere (CA) on reduction of ripening heterogeneity of Hass avocado without being detrimental to fatty acid profile and (ii) to study the potential metabolic processes implicated in such ripening synchronization with focus on cell wall remodelling and ethylene biosynthetic pathways. Results showed that heat shock prior to CA storage significantly reduced ripening heterogeneity in early and middle season fruit while N2 + CA did not. Pectin methyl esterase (PME) and polygalacturonase (PG) activity did not display significant differences among treatments. Additionally, none of the treatments altered the fatty acid profile. ACS transcript for early and middle season fruit kept constant during storage for heat + CA, CA and N2 + CA. ACO instead displayed less abundance after 21 d storage for all treatments of early season fruit. These results point to ripening synchronization in Hass avocado subjected to heat to be related to induction of metabolic processes related to ethylene (biosynthesis), possibly at the action level (receptors) but the efficiency of the heat treatment was related to the maturity stage of the batch.",

One of the limitations of the scholarship has been the conceptualization and operationalization of the WS and poverty as one-dimensional variables. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between welfare state development, single-dimensions deprivations and income inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean, before and after controlling for demographic and cyclical factors. The WS is operationalized as a one-dimensional variable, but also taking into account its multidimensional nature. Three individual deprivations suffered by people on poverty and two income inequality indicators are used as dependent variables. Three pooled time-series cross-section regression analyses with panel-corrected standard errors models were carried out on 18 countries in the region around 2000, 2005 and 2010. This paper shows that the development of social-welfare programs and institutions seems to be an effective way of tackling individual deprivations suffered by people on poverty in the region. On the other hand, the WS development didn\u2019t appear to be effective to reduce income inequality. The outcomes of welfare institutions appear to be the pivotal dimension to reduce income inequality and income deprivations in the region.",

The aim is to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity, now and in the future. Sources of data The UN has established web-sites to inform the implementation of the SDGs and an Inter-Agency and Expert Group on an Indicator Framework. We have searched for independent commentaries and analysis. Areas of agreement The goals represent a framework that is scientifically robust, and widely intuitive intended to build upon the progress established by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). There is a need for system wide strategic planning to integrate the economic, social and environmental dimensions into policy and actions. Areas of controversy Many countries have yet to understand the difference between the MDGs and the SDGs, particularly their universality, the huge potential of new data methods to help with their implementation, and the systems thinking that is needed to deliver the vision. The danger is that individual goals may be prioritized without an understanding of the potential positive interactions between goals. Growing points There is an increasing understanding that sustainable development needs a paradigm shift in our understanding of the interaction between the real economy and quality of life. There would be many social, environmental and economic benefits in changing our current model. Areas timely for developing research We need to develop systems wide understanding of what supports a healthy environment and the art and science of making change.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Background: Congenital microcephaly is the result of a disturbance in early brain development and can have multiple etiologies. Establishing background prevalence of microcephaly in Zika virus (ZIKV)-affected areas is important for improving identification of ZIKV-affected newborns. However, to date, there is limited consistent guidance for the accurate identification of microcephaly in infants of unknown gestational age, a common concern in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: Occipital frontal head circumference (OFC) obtained from infants (0\u201313 days) of unknown gestational age at enrollment in a pregnancy registry in rural Guatemala from August 2014 to March 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Trained community health nurses recorded anthropometry in an online database. In April 2015, ZIKV was identified in this population. Gestational age was approximated in 2 ways: presumed term and estimated using z-score of zero for height on modified Fenton growth curves. After which, z-scores for OFC and weight were obtained. Microcephaly and microcephaly background prevalence were estimated using 7 established microcephaly case definitions from national and international organizations and 3 proposed definitions using Fenton growth curves. Independent associations with microcephaly and OFC, including relationship with date of birth, were assessed with prevalence ratios and linear regression. Results: For 296 infants, the mean OFC was 33.1 cm (range, 29.5 to 37 cm) and the mean OFC z-score was 0.68. Depending on case definition, 13 to 125 infants were classified as having microcephaly (background prevalence 439 to 4,223 per 10,000 live births), and 1 to 9 infants were classified as having severe microcephaly (<3 standard deviation [SD]) (34 to 304 per 10,000 live births). Five (1.7%) infants met all the microcephaly case definitions. Weight 1 SD (prevalence rate [PR], 3.77; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6 to 8.8; P=.002) and small for gestational age (PR, 4.68; 95% CI, 1.8 to 12.3; P=.002) were associated with microcephaly. Date of birth was not associated with OFC z-score or OFC after adjusting for gestational age and gender. Conclusions: Estimated background microcephaly is high in rural Guatemala compared with reported rates in Latin America prior to ZIKV epidemic, which has important implications for neonatal screening programs for congenital ZIKV infection. Fenton growth curves offer a standardized approach to the identification of microcephaly in infants of unknown gestational age.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "This study provided the first comprehensive data on the occurrence and removal of twenty-five target emerging contaminants (ECs) in a full-scale water reclamation plant (WRP) in the Southeast Asian region. Nineteen out of the twenty-five ECs were ubiquitously detected in raw influent samples. Concentrations of the detected ECs in raw influent samples ranged substantially from 44.3 to 124,966 ng/L, depending upon the compound and sampling date. The elimination of ECs in full-scale conventional activated sludge (CAS) and membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems at a local WRP was evaluated and compared. Several ECs, such as acetaminophen, atenolol, fenoprofen, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and oxybenzone, exhibited excellent removal efficiencies (> 90%) in biological wastewater treatment processes, while some of the investigated compounds (carbamazepine, crotamiton, diclofenac, and iopamidol) appeared to be persistent in the both CAS and MBR systems. Field-based monitoring results showed that MBR outperformed CAS in the elimination of most target ECs. The relationship between molecular characteristics of ECs (i.e. physicochemical properties and structural features) and their removal efficiencies during biological wastewater treatment was also elucidated. Excellent removal efficiencies (> 90%) were often noted for ECs with the sole presence of electron donating groups (i.e. phenolic [[sbnd]OH], amine [[sbnd]NH2], methoxy [[sbnd]O[sbnd]CH3], phenoxy [[sbnd]O[sbnd]C6H5], or alkyl groups). Conversely, ECs with the absence of electron donating groups or the predominance of strong electron withdrawing groups (e.g. halogenated, carbonyl, carboxyl, and sulfonamide) tended to show poor removal efficiencies (< 30%) in biological wastewater treatment processes.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Air pollution levels (NO2, PAHs, O3) were investigated, before (BLE) and after (ALE) leaf emergence, in the urban landscape of Gothenburg, Sweden. The aims were to study the 1) spatial and temporal variation in pollution levels between urban green areas, 2) effect of urban vegetation on air pollution levels at the same distance from a major emission source (traffic route), 3) improvement of urban air quality in urban parks compared to adjacent sites near traffic, 4) correlation between air pollution and noise in a park. O3 varied little over the urban landscape. NO2 varied strongly and was higher in situations strongly influenced by traffic. Four PAH variables were included: total PAH, total particle-bound PAH, the quantitatively important gaseous phenanthrene and the highly toxic particle-bound benzo(a)pyrene. The variation of PAHs was similar to NO2, but for certain PAHs the difference between highly and less polluted sites was larger than for NO2. At a vegetated site, NO2 and particulate PAH levels were lower than at a non-vegetated site at a certain distance from a busy traffic route. This effect was significantly larger ALE compared to BLE for NO2, indicating green leaf area to be highly significant factor for air quality improvement. For particulate PAHs, the effect was similar BLE and ALE, indicating that tree bark and branches also could be an important factor in reducing air pollution. Parks represented considerably cleaner local environments (park effect), which is likely to be a consequence of both a dilution (distance effect) and deposition. Noise and air pollution (NO2 and PAH) levels were strongly correlated. Comparison of noise levels BLE and ALE also showed that the presence of leaves significantly reduced noise levels. Our results are evidence that urban green spaces are beneficial for urban environmental quality, which is important to consider in urban planning.",

To perform this, the Mar Menor environmental patterns suffering traditionally from intense coastal urbanization, and in recent years from important eutrophication problems, will be analyzed from an integrated approach and retrospectively assessed through territorial indicators. The evaluation will provide a clear example of a protected area regulated by multiple European Natura 2000 figures of protection that nevertheless is suffering from a strong and varied anthropic process over time. The results will show that paradoxically this process sometimes has little territorial linkage origin with the area concerned. This aspect will be addressed by using GIS indicators, to present the real correlation between coastal urbanization and agricultural land transformation with Mar Menor evolution over time (in which it is pointed out that the weight of the latter is much greater than the former) and how far it is necessary to establish an area of influence of the environmental impacts by proposing a new scope of application for the resolution of the current situation of eutrophication in its waters.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Flint Who poisoned Flint? This question, easy to ask but harder to answer, draws attention to the complex of political and economic institutions, processes, social relations and hydraulic infrastructures involved in urban water governance. Flint, Michigan, a city of 100,000 people northwest of Detroit, is a city in decline. Like other cities and towns in the US \u201crust belt,\u201d Flint\u2019s landscape is marked by abandoned, decaying factories, brownfields (urban spaces too polluted for redevelopment) and crumbling infrastructure. Flint was the founding place of General Motors, which still operates a plant there. Industry downsizing sacked thousands of workers in the 1980s, driving the city\u2019s poverty rate up sharply. De-industrialization and population loss have left the city with a diminished tax base, which barely covers operating costs for basic city services, much less for environmental cleanup and infrastructure upgrades. Some 40 percent of the city\u2019s population lives below the federal poverty line, and city residents, some 52 percent of whom are African-American, had experienced more than their share of problems when, in 2014, they were confronted with another: poisoned water. Prior to that year, Flint received its drinking water from Detroit\u2019s water system, which in turn drew from Lake Huron, part of North America\u2019s Great Lakes system. Flint had plans to connect to a new water pipeline, to be completed in 2016 or 2017, which would provide Lake Huron water directly, at lower cost. As a further cost-saving measure, in April 2014, Flint\u2019s governor-appointed Emergency Manager decided that the city should no longer draw water from Detroit\u2019s system, and should instead begin drawing water from the Flint River, which flows through the city. Like many waterways in and around rust belt cities, the Flint River is acutely contaminated by decades of industrial waste and lax regulation, as well as municipal waste seepage from aging sewer systems (cf. Perreault et al., 2012). As early as August 2014, drinking water tests showed elevated levels of fecal coliform bacteria. Residents were instructed to boil water and the city began treating the water system with chlorine. Between June 2014 and November 2015, Flint also experienced an outbreak of legionnaires\u2019 disease, which eventually claimed the lives of ten people.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Background: The bidirectional relationship between psychiatric disorders and immune dysregulation has been increasingly documented. Moreover, most major mental diseases are notoriously associated with higher prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) emerged as a crucial biomarker in the stratification of cardiovascular risk. Objectives: Reviewing the recent literature upon: neuroinflammation in mood and schizophrenic disorders, the potential use of HSCRP as an inflammatory biomarker in psychiatric disorders and its possible use for the stratification of risk. Method: The authors conducted a MedLine/PubMed search of all articles up to January 2017 using five keywords. The search was supplemented with a manual review of relevant references. Evidences assessing the relationship between CRP plasma levels and psychiatric disorders have been reviewed. Result: Elevated High-Sensitivity CRP (HSCRP) plasma levels have been reported specially in mood disorders, mainly in mania and in a subset of patients with Depression. Childhood trauma and suicidal behaviour represent factors that increase illness vulnerability and influence immune responses. The complex interaction amongst immune and endocrine systems, metabolic parameters and psychopharmacological effects enhance difficulty in understanding the directionality of this relationship. Conclusion: The heterogeneity of findings provided by research could suggest the presence of genetically determined or epigenetic factors in a subgroup of individuals who react to stress factors with an inflammatory hyperactivation. HSCRP could represent a useful biomarker to identify patients with greater risk to develop medical comorbidities that could benefit from anti-inflammatory treatments.",

Improving demand estimation through smart metering, as well as the potential savings from implementing various demand management strategies on the household, regional, and national scales, have been studied in literature. However, there is a lack of research on how these evolving water demand patterns affect the performance of water distribution networks on a network-wide scale. In this study, three residential demand patterns were used: 1) standard diurnal, 2) flattened demand, representing the response to economic incentives or technological mechanisms, and 3) reduced demand, which models the response to efficient end-use technology and alternative water sources. The network dynamics associated with the three scenarios were investigated using a hydraulic simulator. Four metrics are suggested to assess the network-wide performance in each scenario: water loss, peak flow, water age, and energy loss. Results from simulations using a real-world network indicated that decreased consumption and variance in demand had a negative or negligible impact on water loss and age, but there is a potential for savings in terms of reduced energy losses. The results highlight the implications on water management and planning from the network infrastructure and utility side.",

A virtual production function is therefore devise considering tourist flows as output and accommodation capacity and other tourist and cultural resources as the main inputs. We examine Chile as case study, a country with a growing number or tourists and increased investment in tourist and cultural infrastructures. We follow a two-stage model, estimating regional performance using data envelopment analysis and analysing the impact of external variables on efficiency applying bootstrap techniques and truncated regression models. Empirical results show that cultural endowments and activities together with natural resources determine Chilean regional efficiency in optimizing tourist flow, particularly in attracting international tourism. Thus, policy recommendations to improve regional management of tourist and cultural attractions are derived. This study contributes to increase applications in tourist destinations efficiency in Latin America, where works are still scarce.",

The situation of agroecology is currently being considered, with an emphasis on the problems it has faced; 4. The insertion of agrochemicals in conventional agriculture is analyzed; 5. The legal structuring of agroecology in Brazil is presented. It was found that current agriculture has been structured by high dependence on chemical inputs, intensive mechanization and unsustainable use of natural resources, so it is necessary to have a dialogue of these practices with the actions of agroecology.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "This research investigates exploratory environmental initiatives in tourism companies in Mallorca over five years, with special consideration to those involving partnerships and synergies with other parties (including academic ones), in an exploration of Social Innovation (SI) approaches in the industry. The paper starts with an outline of the growing importance of sustainability within the hospitality industry and its inherent relation with SI. The study draws its empirical material from ten innovative practices on sustainability from small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and a big hotel chain in Mallorca. The data were collected by means of questionnaires and interviews. All cases incorporated SI features (partnerships, synergies, circular processes, systemic approach), developing, therefore, towards an integrated system of SI policy and practice. The study indicates that embracing environmental principles alongside social and economic concerns can lead to a systemic approach and these commitments can be regarded as a more solid model of sustainability.",

In the era of great health, Guizhou province put forward the concept of global tourism in a timely manner, which provides a good opportunity to develop the tourism industry. In order to promote the integration of tourism industry on the basis of the actual situation of Guizhou Province, we put forward the overall goals and problems in order to integrate with the tourism industry in one area of Guizhou province, and established the extension model. Then, we analyzed the model by using the divergent analysis, correlation analysis, conjugation analysis and contained analysis. Finally, we do the extension change and obtained some innovation strategy and solved the contradiction problem that exists in the process of the development of tourism industry integration. The method may provide some ideas to realize the intelligence, systematization and sustainable development of tourism industry in Guizhou Province.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) restoration is needed across vast areas, especially after large wildfires, to restore important ecosystem services. Sagebrush restoration success is inconsistent, with a high rate of seeding failures, particularly at lower elevations. Seed enhancement technologies may overcome limitations to restoration success. Seed pillows are one such technology designed to improve seed-soil contact in broadcast seedings by providing a favorable medium for seedling establishment and growth. Seed pillows have shown promising results in greenhouse studies; however, they have not been evaluated in the field. We compared broadcast-seeding seed pillows with broadcast-seeding bare seed in 2 yr across a large, burned elevation gradient. Compared with bare seed, we found no evidence that seed pillows improved sagebrush establishment and growth across the elevation gradient. Though our results suggest that seed pillows do not increase the likelihood of successful sagebrush restoration, they were successful at times when bare seeds were not, and the same was true for bare seeds. At least one of the two treatments was successful at 50% of the elevations over the 2 seeding yr. This suggests that a bet hedging approach, seeding both bare seed and seed pillows, may increase the probability of success. Further supporting the use of bet hedging, if both methods were used and seeding occurred in both years, success would have been 86%. Sagebrush density and cover varied by elevation. In the first-yr seeding, sagebrush density and cover generally increased with increasing elevation. In the second-yr seeding, sagebrush density and cover were greatest at the lowest and highest elevations. We speculate that at the lower elevations an unusually wet spring combined with limited herbaceous vegetation provided an ideal environment for sagebrush establishment and growth. Our results also demonstrate, counter to common assumptions, that lower elevations sagebrush seedings can be successful.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Purpose: The tenuous financial viability of many of Georgia\u2019s rural hospitals has driven increased scrutiny of the hospital authorities (HAs) that own and govern them. HAs are a type of \u201cspecial district\u201d established in state law to allow for specialization of function, while evading statutes that can limit local government borrowing and multi-year contracts. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a case example to introduce transparency and accountability in one local Georgia hospital and expands to include a descriptive analysis of transparency measures in 29 rural Georgia HAs. Findings: Findings indicate that, like many other special districts in Georgia and the USA, Georgia\u2019s rural HAs often act more like private entities than the public organizations they are. The lack of transparency demonstrated in this sector limits access to public information and reduces opportunities for citizen engagement, a necessary component of representative institutions. Research limitations/implications: This case study is limited to Georgia HAs; however, the data support the lack of accountability and transparency found in many special district governments. Originality/value: The lack of transparency in all of the organizations reviewed in this study demonstrates blurred lines between between public matters and private interests and raises questions of transparency, a key value in democracies.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Aims: The Drug Education in Victorian Schools (DEVS) programme taught about licit and illicit drugs over two years (2010\u20132011), with follow up in the third year (2012). It focussed on minimising harm and employed participatory, critical-thinking and skill-focussed pedagogy. This study evaluated the programme\u2019s residual effectiveness at follow up in reducing alcohol-related risk and harm. Methods: A cluster-randomised, controlled trial was conducted with a student cohort during years eight (13\u201314 years old), nine (14\u201315 years old) and 10 (15\u201316 years old). Schools were randomly allocated to the DEVS programme (14 schools, n = 1163), or their usual drug education (7 schools, n = 589). Multi-level models were fitted to the data, which were analysed on an intent-to-treat basis. Statistically significant findings: Over the 3 years, there was a greater increase in intervention students\u2019 knowledge about drugs, including alcohol. Their alcohol consumption did not increase as much as controls. Their alcohol-related harms decreased, while increasing for controls. There were fewer intervention group risky drinkers, and they reduced their consumption compared to controls. Similarly, harms decreased for intervention group risky drinkers, while increasing for controls. Conclusions: Skill-focussed, harm minimisation drug education can remain effective, subsequent to programme completion, in reducing students\u2019 alcohol consumption and harm, even with risky drinkers.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The Tokyo Metropolitan Government, seeking to break an impasse in its state-sponsored war-damage reconstruction efforts after the Second World War, presented proposals in the late 1940s to reclaim centuries-old canals in its central area to dispose of wartime rubble and create land for redevelopment. The Government also received a proposal forwarded by Japan\u2019s professional baseball association to reclaim a scenic pond in central Tokyo and build a baseball stadium there, and it responded favourably. Two canal reclamation projects were realized, but the pond reclamation was eventually abandoned. These reclamation proposals provoked debates of varying intensity over the loss of traditional scenery as part of urban reconstruction. This paper examines those debates and interprets their meaning within the history of Japan\u2019s city planning. It notes the awakening of concern for land use planning after reclamation\u2013in particular, the preservation of locations of scenic value\u2013in the context of urban reconstruction. The paper also considers the limited nature of civic space for public discourse and debate over planning proposals and a collusive aspect of the inter-governmental relationship in city planning. It also considers the attitudes towards reclamation displayed by Hideaki Ishikawa, the principal planner of Tokyo\u2019s war-damage reconstruction plan.",

The current United States estimate of Toxocara exposure is 13.9% (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] III [1988-1994]). Methods We used a multiplex bead-based assay (Tc-CTL-1MBA) with purified Toxocara canis antigen to estimate Toxocara antibody seroprevalence in serum of 13 509 persons aged \u22656 years from NHANES 2011-2014 and identified seropositivity risk factors. We tested a subset of 500 samples with the T. canis enzyme immunoassay used in NHANES III to estimate prior seroprevalence had samples from NHANES III been tested by Tc-CTL-1MBA. Results The age-standardized estimate of Toxocara seroprevalence was 5.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.2%-5.8%), lower than previously reported even after adjusting for increased Tc-CTL-1MBA specificity. Risk factors for seropositivity from multiple logistic regression were older age, non-Hispanic black/Hispanic origin, male sex, living below poverty level, households with \u22650.5 persons per room, less than college education, and birth outside of the United States. Conclusions Toxocara seroprevalence estimates in 2011-2014 were lower than in a study from NHANES III (1988-1994), but seropositivity risk factors remained the same and should continue to be the focus of prevention efforts.",

Reducing Inequalities has been written by leading academics in the field who describe the current social situation in the European Union, focussing on inequality from a multidimensional perspective that includes income, poverty, social exclusion, education. The authors argue that social issues such as these have become national prerogatives for countries within the European Union. In response they ask: How does the European Union engage with inequality today? What principles of social solidarity ought to be applied between states and citizens of the European Union? What should be the role of European Union and its institutions regarding the challenge of reducing inequality? This book will be of interest to anyone seeking to understand inequality as a multidimensional concept, rather than solely as an economic phenomenon, across different geographical and historical contexts.",

A field experiment was carried out for two consecutive years (2014 and 2015) to evaluate the response of a new cotton variety (cv. Rassafa) to N-fertilizer and drip irrigation. Explanation: Treatments consisted of five different N-rates (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg N ha-1), and three irrigation modes: full irrigation (FI), fixed partial rootzone drying irrigation (FPRD80), and alternate partial rootzone drying irrigation (APRD80). They received 100, 80, and 80% of the seasonal water use, respectively. Cotton was irrigated when soil moisture in the specified active root depth was 80% of the field capacity as designated by the neutron probe. Results: Results indicated that seed cotton yield (SCY), dry matter (DM), and water productivity (WP) could be optimized at an average N-rate of 140 kg N ha-1, for the tested cotton cultivar, whatever the irrigation mode used. In contrast to APRD80 mode, the findings showed that both FI and FPRD80 modes exhibited a consistence over years, but with an obvious preference of FI in SCY, DM, and WP.",

This paper discusses four additional mechanisms that can be explained by bounded rationality: (a) implicit discrimination, (b) self-stereotyping and self-censorship, (c) rules of thumb adapted to disadvantaged environments that are dysfunctional in more privileged settings, and (d) adaptive preferences, in which an excluded group comes to view its exclusion as natural. Institutions, if they are stable, come to have cognitive foundations-concepts, categories, social identities, and worldviews-through which peoplemediate their perceptions of themselves and theworld around them. Abolishing or reforming a discriminatory institutionmay have little effect on the social categories it created; groups previously discriminated against by lawmay remain excluded through custom and habits of themind. Recognizing newforces of social exclusion, behavioral economics identifies ways to offset them. Some interventions have had very consequential impacts.",

Materials and methods: Data on all non-spinal open fractures admitted to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh after a road traffic accident between 1988 and 2010 were collected and analysed to provide information about the changing epidemiology in different patient groups. Demographic information was collected on all patients with the severity of injury being analysed with the Injury Severity Score (ISS), Musculoskeletal Index (MSI) and the number of open fractures. The severity of the open fractures was analysed using the Gustilo classification. The 23-year study period was divided into four shorter periods and the results were compared. Results: There were 696 patients treated in 23 years. Analysis showed that the incidence of RTA open fractures initially fell in both males and females and continued to fall in females during the 23 years. In males it levelled off about 2000. The age of the female patients also fell during the study period but it did not change in males. The only patient group to show an increased incidence of open fractures were cyclists. In vehicle occupants the incidence fell throughout the study period but it levelled off in pedestrians and motorcyclists. There was no difference in the severity of injury in any group during the study period. The most severe open fractures were those of the distal femur and femoral diaphysis although open tibial diaphyseal fractures were the most common fracture in all patient groups. Conclusions: Improved car design and road safety legislation has resulted in a reduction in the incidence of open fractures in vehicle occupants, pedestrians and motorcyclists. The most obvious group to have benefitted from this are older female pedestrians. The only group to show an increase in age during the study period were male motorcyclists.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The chemical and seasonal characteristics of fine particulates in Seoul, Korea, were investigated based on 24-h integrated PM2.5 measurements made over four 1-month periods in each season between October 2012 and September 2013. The four-season average concentration of PM2.5 was 37 \u03bcg m\u22123, and the major chemical components were secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) species of sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium (49%), followed by organic matter (34%). The mass concentration and most of the chemical components of PM2.5 showed clear seasonal variation, with a winter-high and summer-low pattern. The winter-to-summer sulfate ratio and the winter organic carbon (OC)-to-elemental carbon (EC) ratio were unusually high compared with those in previous studies. Strong correlations of both the sulfate level and the sulfur oxidation ratio with relative humidity, and between water-soluble OC (WSOC) and SIA in winter, suggest the importance of aqueous phase chemistry for secondary aerosols. A strong correlation between non-sea salt sulfate and Na+ levels, a high Cl\u2212/Na+ ratio, and an unusual positive correlation between the nitrogen oxidation ratio and temperature during the winter indicate the influence of transported secondary emission sources from upwind urban areas and from China across the Yellow Sea. Despite the absence of local forest fires and the regulation of wood burning, a high levoglucosan concentration and its correlations with OC and WSOC indicate that Seoul was affected by biomass burning sources in the winter. The unusually high water-insoluble OC (WIOC)-to-EC ratio in winter implies additional transported combustion sources of WIOC. The strong correlation between WIOC and levoglucosan suggests the likely influence of transported biomass burning sources on the high WIOC/EC ratio during the winter.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Microplastics exposure could be detrimental to marine organisms especially under high concentrations. However, few studies have considered the multiphasic nature of marine invertebrates\u2019 life history and investigated the impact of experiencing microplastics during early development on post-metamorphic stages (legacy effect). Many planktonic larvae can feed selectively and it is unclear whether such selectivity could modulate the impact of algal food-sized microplastic. In this two-stage experiment, veligers of Crepidula onyx were first exposed to additions of algae-sized micro-polystyrene (micro-PS) beads at different concentrations, including ones that were comparable their algal diet. These additions were then either halted or continued after settlement. At environmentally relevant concentration (ten 2-\u03bcm microplastic beads ml\u22121), larval and juvenile C. onyx was not affected. At higher concentrations, these micro-PS fed larvae consumed a similar amount of algae compared to those in control but grew relatively slower than those in the control suggesting that ingestion and/or removal of microplastic was/were energetically costly. These larvae also settled earlier at a smaller size compared to the control, which could negatively affect post-settlement success. Juvenile C. onyx receiving continuous micro-PS addition had slower growth rates. Individuals only exposed to micro-PS during their larval stage continued to have slower growth rates than those in the control even if micro-PS had been absent in their surroundings for 65 days highlighting a legacy effect of microplastic exposure.",

    "title": "Using fuzzy logic to determine the vulnerability of marine species to climate change",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Marine species are being impacted by climate change and ocean acidification, although their level of vulnerability varies due to differences in species' sensitivity, adaptive capacity and exposure to climate hazards. Due to limited data on the biological and ecological attributes of many marine species, as well as inherent uncertainties in the assessment process, climate change vulnerability assessments in the marine environment frequently focus on a limited number of taxa or geographic ranges. As climate change is already impacting marine biodiversity and fisheries, there is an urgent need to expand vulnerability assessment to cover a large number of species and areas. Here, we develop a modelling approach to synthesize data on species-specific estimates of exposure, and ecological and biological traits to undertake an assessment of vulnerability (sensitivity and adaptive capacity) and risk of impacts (combining exposure to hazards and vulnerability) of climate change (including ocean acidification) for global marine fishes and invertebrates. We use a fuzzy logic approach to accommodate the variability in data availability and uncertainties associated with inferring vulnerability levels from climate projections and species' traits. Applying the approach to estimate the relative vulnerability and risk of impacts of climate change in 1074 exploited marine species globally, we estimated their index of vulnerability and risk of impacts to be on average 52 \u00b1 19 SD and 66 \u00b1 11 SD, scaling from 1 to 100, with 100 being the most vulnerable and highest risk, respectively, under the \u2018business-as-usual' greenhouse gas emission scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5). We identified 157 species to be highly vulnerable while 294 species are identified as being at high risk of impacts. Species that are most vulnerable tend to be large-bodied endemic species. This study suggests that the fuzzy logic framework can help estimate climate vulnerabilities and risks of exploited marine species using publicly and readily available information.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Young stands are commonly assumed to require centuries to develop into late-successional forest habitat. This viewpoint reflects the fact that young stands often lack many of the structural features that define late-successional habitat, and that these features derive from complex stand dynamics that are difficult to mimic with forest management. Variable density thinning (VDT) is a silvicultural strategy designed to accelerate development of late-successional habitat by applying a variety of harvest intensities within a stand. Previous reports indicate that VDT has had initial success increasing growth and regeneration. However, few studies have examined the effects of VDT at longer time scales. Here, we report 14-year growth response of residual trees in the thinned and unthinned VDT sub-treatments in five young mixed-conifer stands located on the Olympic Peninsula in western Washington. Our objectives were to investigate whether thinning has accelerated the recruitment of large trees (>80 cm dbh), recruitment of shade-tolerant species into the mid-story (40\u201365 cm), or development of longer crowns relative to the unthinned sub-treatment. In addition, we investigated whether the basal area distribution in the combined VDT sub-treatments has become more diverse compared to the unthinned sub-treatment. The response to thinning varied consistently across the diameter size class gradient. Thinning was ineffective at stimulating growth of upper canopy trees (65\u201380 cm). In this size class neither diameter growth nor crown length increased significantly compared to trees in unthinned patches. Further, only one stand has reached the restoration benchmark for large tree density. In contrast, thinning significantly increased diameter growth and crown length among trees in the mid-story (40\u201365 cm) and shade-tolerant species in the future mid-story (20\u201340 cm). Higher rates of recruitment into the mid-story were also observed from shade tolerant species growing in the thinned (34%) compared to unthinned (19%) patches, with two stands reaching the restoration benchmark for shade-tolerant mid-story density. Clear trends in basal area diversity and evenness have yet to develop in either the combined or unthinned sub-treatments. Collectively, our results demonstrate that VDT has partially accomplished its objectives. Although thinning has not yet accelerated recruitment of large trees, it has accelerated the advancement of shade-tolerant species into the mid-story and the development of deeper crowns among trees in smaller size classes. In addition, differing rates of diameter growth among smaller diameter trees in the various VDT sub-treatments suggest that increases in structural diversity may be developing more quickly than in untreated stands.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Mangrove cover is increasing in estuaries and harbours in many areas on North Island, New Zealand. The expansion of mangroves has been attributed to anthropogenic land-use change, including urbanisation and conversion of land to agriculture. Rapid expansion of mangroves in the coastal landscape has created discord in local communities over their importance in terms of the services they deliver to both wildlife and people. Some community groups have been advocates for the large-scale removal of mangrove habitat, whilst other local residents oppose this removal. This review paper investigated and discussed pertinent biodiversity and ecosystem services studies based in New Zealand mangroves from 1950 to 2017. Results showed that the majority of biodiversity studies have targeted particular species or groups of organisms, with a focus on benthic invertebrate communities. Deficits remain in our knowledge of this expanding forest and shrub ecosystem, notably the terrestrial component of biodiversity, species community-shifts with landscape fragmentation, and associated cultural values. It is recommended that broader species assessments and a longer-term approach be applied to biodiversity monitoring in mangroves, coupled with M\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori (M\u0101ori knowledge) and western science for holistic management of this coastal ecosystem.",

While the strategies such as selection of eco-materials, reduction of packaging sizes, optimization of energy use, or elimination of the use of toxic materials have been adopted, currently, decision-makers might have to evaluate their designs using some qualitative ecodesign techniques, but there is not much they can do to further enhance their designs\u2019 environmental performances. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is one of the generally accepted approaches to quantitatively assess product-oriented environmental impact. The results of LCA, to some extent, may help designers to understand the potential environmental impact generated by their design options. However, there is very limited information that can be given to show how to redesign their products to further reduce the environmental impact. In this connection, we propose an approach to search for the best assembly sequence in order to lower the overall environmental impact. A simplified LCA is used to quantify the environmental impacts of design options. ACO algorithm is then applied to identify a better assembly sequence with the lowest environmental impact value. A case study is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Our current economic model is experiencing increasing demand and increasing pressure on resource utilisation, as valuable materials are lost as waste. Moving towards a circular economy and supporting efficient resource utilisation is essential for protecting the environment. The chlor-alkali industry is one of the largest consumers of salt, and efforts have been made to reduce its electricity use. Furthermore, KCl mining wastes have received increasing attention because they can be transformed into value-added resources. This work studies the influence of using different salt sources on the environmental sustainability of the chlor-alkali industry to identify further improvement opportunities. Rock salt, solar salt, KCl waste salt, vacuum salt and solution-mined salt were studied. Membrane cells in both bipolar and monopolar configurations were studied and compared to the emergent oxygen-depolarised cathode (ODC) technology. Life cycle assessment was applied to estimate the cradle-to-gate environmental impacts. The natural resource (NR) requirements and the environmental burdens (EBs) to the air and water environments were assessed. The total NR and EB requirements were reduced by 20% when vacuum salt was replaced with KCl. Moreover, the environmental impacts estimated for the monopolar membrane using KCl were comparable to those generated for the bipolar membrane using VS. The difference between the monopolar and bipolar scenarios (17%) was slightly higher than that between the bipolar and ODC technologies (12%). This work demonstrates the importance of studying every life cycle stage in a chemical process and the environmental benefit of applying a circular economy, even in energy intensive industries such as the chlor-alkali industry.",

Semi-structured interviews with 15 leading experts or employees responsible for care transition were conducted and subjected to content analysis. Results: Invasively ventilated patients' pathways into intensive home care tend to be highly random, risky and uncertain. Coordination and cooperation issues, as well as nontransparent and unclear interests of stakeholders and officials emerged. Rehabilitation opportunities do not seem to be systematically used to their full potential and demands for informed and participatory decision-making processes tend to be neglected.

Such tools are essential with overfishing now reducing stocks and employment worldwide, with in turn many serious social, economic, and environmental implications. Increasingly, a state-space framework is being used in place of deterministic and standard parametric stock assessment models.

The proportion of most dominant phyla and classes in the sample decreased with an increase in diffusion distance. There were mainly 55 species pathogenic bacteria in the water discharging into the sea. The pathogenic genes in the discharge were mainly related to cancer, cardiovascular disease, immune system diseases, infectious diseases, metabolic diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. When compared with the blank samples, it was found that the biomass of pathogenic bacteria decreased sharply with the diffusion by the seawater, and most of the pathogens were not detected 1000 m away from the seashore. Arcobacter spp. caused human and animal diarrhea and bacteremia, Acinetobacter spp. caused nosocomial infections, and Shewanella hafniensis posed a threat to seafood farming and fishing. The three species of pathogenic bacteria mentioned above occupied a fairly large proportion of the discharge into the sea.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Over the next two decades, China, the country with the world\u2019s largest urban population, is orchestrating the urbanization of some 300 million rural people. In its National New-Type Urbanization Plan (2014) the State Council has outlined a range of strategies to grow its cities not least of which is rural-to-urban migration. This plan will have significant effects on other types of displacement, particularly, the forced displacement and resettlement of those living in the path of large dams. This paper reviews what is known about New-Type Urbanization Approach to Reservoir Resettlement. Then, based on a longitudinal study of 145 resettled households at the Three Gorges Dam, the livelihood effects of rural-to-urban resettlement are unpacked to provide lessons for its use in advancing urbanization. It finds that rural-to-urban resettlers have lower incomes than their urban-to-urban and rural-to-rural counterparts, and higher rates of food and income insecurity.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The main objective of this study is to develop an approach to reveal suitable areas using geographical information systems (GIS) via spatial analysis based on screening criteria in Edirne, Turkey. Turkey is one of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries with the fastest growth in energy demand. Including nuclear energy as a source of energy is extremely important for Turkey to meet this growing electricity demand and reduce the risks that result from dependency on imported fuels. In addition, nuclear energy is introduced as \u201cnational energy\u201d to boost political motivation and public support against dependency on imported natural gas. A nuclear power plant with four pressurized water reactors (PWR) with 1000MWe capacity was suggested in the study. Nuclear power plants require a special safety regime, unlike other power generation plants and industrial sites. Safety approach begins with analytical work for site selection and evaluation. Criteria based on this approach should be evaluated not only in the construction, operation, and decommissioning stage, but also during the site selection process. Proximity to capable faults, seismicity, availability of cooling water, population, flooding, topography, environmental sensitivity, proximity to national borders, electrical grid, transportation opportunities and hazardous facilities were chosen as screening criteria. Whole province was evaluated with screening criteria in GIS and five candidate sites were proposed. Weighted Linear Combination method was applied to support the decision making process. The study revealed that there are some suitable locations for developing a nuclear power plant project in the southern coast of Edirne and some areas in Ergene riverside.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Poaching of both black (Diceros bicornis) and white (Ceratotherium simum) rhinoceros in Africa has increased significantly in recent years. In an effort to ensure the survival of these critically endangered species, breeding programs were established in the 1990s in Australia, where a similar climate and habitat is available. In this study we examined blood samples from two C. simum, including a 16 yr old female (Aluka) who died in captivity, and a 17 yr old asymptomatic male (Umfana). Bloods from seven healthy D. bicornis housed at the zoo were also collected. All samples were tested for the presence of piroplasms via blood smear and PCR. A generic PCR for the 18S rRNA gene of the Piroplasmida revealed the presence of piroplasm infection in both dead and asymptomatic C. simum. Subsequent sequencing of these amplicons revealed the presence of Theileria bicornis. Blood smear indicated that this organism was present at low abundance in both affected and asymptomatic individuals and was not linked to the C. simum mortality. T. bicornis was also detected in the D. bicornis population (n = 7) housed at Taronga Western Plains Zoo using PCR and blood film examination; however only animals imported from Africa (n = 1) tested T. bicornis positive, while captive-born animals bred within Australia (n = 6) tested negative suggesting that transmission within the herd was unlikely. Phylogenetic analysis of the full length T. bicornis 18S rRNA genes classified this organism outside the clade of the transforming and non-transforming Theileria with a new haplotype, H4, identified from D. bicornis. This study revealed the presence of Theileria bicornis in Australian captive populations of both C. simum and D. bicornis and a new haplotype of the parasite was identified.",

The complete supply chain, manufacture, use, and end-of-life phases for reusable and disposable cleanroom coveralls are compared on a cradle-to-end-of-life cycle basis. Three industry representative coveralls are examined: A reusable woven polyethylene terephthalate (PET) coverall, a disposable flash spunbonded high-density polyethylene (HDPE) coverall, and a disposable spunbond-meltblown-spunbond polypropylene (SMS PP) coverall. The reusable cleanroom coverall system shows substantial improvements over both disposable cleanroom coverall systems in all environmental impact categories. The improvements over the disposable HDPE coverall were 34% lower process energy (PE), 23% lower natural resource energy (NRE), 27% lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and 73% lower blue water consumption. The improvements over the disposable SMS PP coverall were 59% lower PE, 56% lower NRE, 57% lower GHG emissions, and 77% lower blue water consumption. In addition, the reusable system shows a 94-96% reduction in solid waste to the landfill from the cleanroom facility. Between the two disposable cleanroom coveralls, the flash spunbonded HDPE coverall shows a measurable environmental improvement over the SMS PP coverall.",

The survey assessed ECEs\u2019: a) perceptions of the quality of addressing sexuality and gender in early learning centres; b) current level of preparation in addressing the development of sexuality; and, c) sexuality training needs. Collectively, participants identified a variety of approaches to sexuality, spoke to themes of inadequate climates to address sexuality education, and the relational characteristics ECEs felt were beneficial for addressing sexuality and gender. Participants (65.6%) recognized the everyday opportunities in which they could engage in discourses of sexuality. Nevertheless, a lack of training to address these domains was notable, with 53.2% reporting inadequate preparation in their current role as an ECE. Findings are discussed in response to a paucity of curriculum documents, which hinders professionals\u2019 ability to adopt an emergent approach to address sexuality and gender.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Wettability alteration is known to occur in low salinity waterflooding of carbonate rocks. Oil droplets are thought to detach from the rock partially due to changes of the solid surface charge by multi-ion exchange with the brine. These mechanisms have been investigated in the past by measuring zeta potentials of calcite and oil, separately in test brines. In this work, the coupled calcite-brine-oil system was studied by measuring the adhesion force of an organic acid functionalized solid probe with a calcite surface, using an atomic force microscope. Brine compositions were varied in pH and ion concentration, to identify key conditions for minimum oil adhesion to calcite. Our experiments showed the strongest acid-calcite adhesion in formation brine. The adhesion force decreased in decreasing ionic strength NaCl brines, particularly below \u223c0.1 mol/L where the diffuse double layer expanded greatly. The complex composition brines of ultra-dilute seawater and excess sulfate seawater each gave the lowest adhesion due to a combination of double layer expansion, surface charge change and gypsum passivation of the calcite surface. Modifying seawater's Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations showed little change in the adhesion force despite being potential determining ions for calcite. Adhesion force responded the most to pH change. Increasing pH substantially decreased the adhesion force in seawater and excess sulfate seawater until a threshold value of pH 10. Above pH 10, the adhesion increased due to brine instability (to mineral precipitation) and material precipitation onto the calcite surface.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Introduction: Youth in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are at increased risk for poor mental health due to economic and social disadvantage. Interventions that strengthen families may equip children and adolescents with the supports and resources to fulfill their potential and buffer them from future stressors and adversity. Due to human resource constraints, task-sharing- delivery of interventions by nonspecialists- may be an effective strategy to facilitate the dissemination of mental health interventions in low resource contexts. To this end, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on family-based interventions delivered in LMICs by nonspecialist providers (NSPs) targeting youth mental health and family related outcomes. Method: Cochrane and PRISMA procedures guided this review. Searches were conducted in PsychInfo, PubMed, and Web of Science, with additional articles pulled from reference lists. Results: This search yielded 10 studies. Four studies were developed specifically for the delivery context using formative qualitative research; the remaining interventions underwent adaptation for use in the context. All interventions employed a period of structured training; nine studies additionally provided ongoing supervision to counselors. Interventions noted widespread acceptance of program material and delivery by NSPs. They also noted the need for ongoing supervision of NSPs to increase treatment fidelity. Discussion: Usage of NSPs is quite consistently proving feasible, acceptable, and efficacious and is almost certainly a valuable component within approaches to scaling up mental health programs. A clear next step is to establish and evaluate sustainable models of training and supervision to further inform scalability.",

The Atlantic cod is a key species and a globally important food source, thus continuous monitoring of PAHs is considered highly valuable to ensure ecosystem sustainability and human food safety. PAH adducts to plasma proteins are applied as sensitive biomarkers of PAH exposure in humans and other species, thus the presence of PAH protein adducts in Atlantic cod plasma was investigated to identify PAH protein adduct biomarker candidates of exposure to PAHs. Blood plasma samples were collected from Atlantic cod (n = 66) one week after exposure by intramuscular injection of single PAHs (i.e. naphthalene and chrysene), and their corresponding dihydrodiol metabolites (i.e. (-)-(1R,2R)-1,2-dihydronaphthalene-1,2-diol and (-)-(1R,2R)-1,2-dihydrochrysene-1,2-diol). The samples were analyzed by shotgun tandem mass spectrometry (MS) and the resulting MS data were analyzed in Byonic\u2122 to screen for proteins susceptible to adduct formation with naphthalene and chrysene. Furthermore, a wildcard modification search was performed to obtain additional information regarding potential modifications other than the targeted metabolites. The amino acid adductation sites and the metabolites involved in PAH adductation are reported. Forty-four proteins were found to bind PAHs. Alpha-2-macroglobulin-like proteins, apolipoproteins B-100-like proteins and an alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein were detected with the highest number of bound PAHs.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Cambodia\u2019s current abortion rate and ratio could be among the highest in Southeast Asia. In 1997, the Cambodian parliament passed the first law regulating abortions. This law was adopted to contribute to reduce the high maternal mortality ratio, as a significant number of maternal deaths were believed to be related to complications of unsafe abortion. A decade later, the Ministry of Health had not yet established medical protocols for safe abortion access and women often continued to induce their own terminations or seek unsafe services. However, in 2009, the Cambodian authorities approved the importation and distribution of one manufactured abortion pill. In addition, manual vacuum abortions and medical abortion training programmes were implemented at the referral hospital level. How has this situation come about? What do we know about the local agencies of the transnational reproductive health policies related to safe abortion access in this country? This paper aims to analyse how history and intersections between global interventions, state policies, local moralities and individual strategies shape abortion policies, practices and technologies. Finally, our findings raise some issues for public health programming.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Wastewater treatment (WWT) produces a biomass or sludge that must be dewatered in order to reduce its volume and subsequent disposal costs. Although WWT sludges can be compressed to high solids concentrations under enough force, they are also highly impermeable such that it takes a long time to remove the water. This leads to low throughputs for dewatering devices such as filters and centrifuges, which means that dewatering contributes a significant proportion of the overall cost of WWT. Improvements to throughput at a given final solids concentration or higher solids concentrations at a given throughput can represent substantial cost savings to the WWT industry. Recent developments in understanding the highly compressible nature of WWT sludges have led to a fundamentally rigorous description of their dewaterability. In addition, methods have been developed for measuring their compressibility and permeability over a broad range of solids concentrations, which allows the prediction of their behaviour using models of dewatering devices. In this work, the dewatering properties of an Australian WWT sludge are used in a validated model of flexible-membrane or diaphragm plate-and-frame filtration. The model is used to optimise the filtration time to give the maximum throughput for various values of cavity width and handling time. Flexible-membrane filtration is versatile in that there is a given squeeze time to reach a certain solids concentration for each fill time, but there is only one combination of fill and squeeze that maximises the throughput. This work shows that, due to the highly impermeable nature of WWT sludges, the maximum throughput is when the fill time is the shortest such that filter presses for WWT sludges are optimally operated by loading enough sludge to fill the press and then immediately squeezing. For slow-filtering materials such as WWT sludges, the maximum throughput varies inversely with cavity width such that small cavity widths, within the constraints of cake release, are preferable.",

As part of their mission they have collected a longitudinal database of more than 33,000 children, recording their evolution during 23 years, with 47 measured variables. Having such rich data is both a blessing and a curse, as deriving insights from it is a daunting task. In this paper we present the results of a visual analytics project that has been enabling the analysts of the Fundaci\u00f3n Canguro to derive insights in ways they couldn't do before. To support the project, we present a process model o framework that can be applied to any time based process where the results of an event are evaluated. For the problem at hand, the model considers the environment (before the event), pregnancy (development of the event), birth (the event), and growth (after the event). Using this model, a visual analytics tool was developed and implemented, and has been used by the analysts for the last months for deriving insights. The tool was developed applying Tamara Munzner's Visual Analytics framework [14] using advanced interactions and information visualizations, including a customized time series diagram. To demonstrate the value of the tool, we present two example case studies were analysts were able to conclude that educated women are less prone to have unwanted pregnancies, and that the implementation of a national law to increase maternity leave generated better feeding patterns on premature children in the Country.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are emphatic on the role of energy for development, with a target to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services to about 1.3 billion people without electricity access, and to increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. For remote rural communities in developing countries, where grid extension is often expensive, decentralized biomass mini-grids can be a reliable electricity supply solution. This study investigated the technical and financial feasibility of decentralized electrification based on agricultural waste gasification in five Ghanaian communities. Results show that the projected electricity demand of the communities compares favorably with the potential energy generation from available agricultural residues, a situation that we envisage in many rural communities where agriculture is a predominant livelihood activity. As with most biomass electricity analysis, it is not profitable from the perspective of an entrepreneur with 100% private funding; however, by applying a customer tariff equal to the current expenditure on electricity equivalent uses in the communities, a subsidy of about 35% on initial investment would enable a private entrepreneur an internal rate of return of 15%, whereas a 60% subsidy could enable internal rate of return of 25%.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is aggressive and typically has a poor prognosis. Chemokines have chemoattractant potential for cancer metastasis. Here, we investigated the chemokine signatures in BC subtypes and the underlying mechanisms that enhance proinflammatory chemokines in TNBC. Analysis from microarray dataset revealed that basal-like BC subtype including TNBC expressed dominantly proinflammatory chemokines, such as CXCL1 and 8, compared to non- TNBC. Chemokine PCR array confirmed the dominant chemokines in TNBC cells. To identify a driving factor for proinflammatory chemokines in TNBC cells, we determined the expression and signaling profiles of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members. TNBC cells expressed higher levels of EGFR and phosphorylated Akt/Erk than non-TNBC cells. In addition, EGF further enhanced the proinflammatory chemokines in TNBC cells, including CXCL2. Knockdown of Akt reduced the CXCL2 promoter activity, while overexpression of Akt enhanced it. MK2206, an Akt inhibitor, reduced the CXCL2 promoter activity, while inhibition and knockdown of Erk did not reduce its activity. We found that transforming growth factor alpha (TGFa) could serve as a main ligand for EGFR to drive EGFR-mediated Akt activation in TNBC cells. MK2206 decreased TGFa promoter activity, while overexpression of Akt increased it. MK2206 also reduced TGFa release from TNBC cells. Moreover, MK2206 downregulated CXCL2 mRNA expression, while TGFa upregulated it. Taken together, the TGFa-EGFRAkt signaling axis can play a role in enhancing proinflammatory chemokine expression in TNBC, subsequently contributing to the inflammatory burden that ultimately lead to cancer progression and a higher mortality rate among TNBC patients.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Algiers, like developing world large cities, has known a massive urbanisation wave, due an increasing birth rate and migration from the interior of the country, which provokes many urban problems such as housing, transportation, unemployment and environmental issues. Moreover, the government has implemented many programmes and plans to resolve those problems. All failed because they took a political approach based on centralised management which neglected the participation of local actors. Following the political openness in the early 90s, the government has made many efforts to develop a legal framework which empowers citizens' participation, with the role of women especially emphasised. Although the principle of citizens' participation in urban development has recently been disseminated in Algerian society, women's participation is still poor. The main aims of the paper are to show the actual situation of citizen participation in an Algiers metropolitan area (AMA), to evaluate the role of women in the urban development process, and, finally, to illustrate the attempts of both civil society and government to involve women. This chapter considers this a particularly important theme because participation in development is one of the factors which can discourage or stimulate migration flux from southern Mediterranean cities towards the northern shore if better development is carried out through women's empowerment.",

This waterway has been severely polluted with heavy metalsasaresultofmining activities. Methodology : A total of 22 surface sediment samples were collected from sampling sites in four typical areas representing the entire Le'An river. We compared the measured results to the background values. The geo-accumulation index (Igeo), integrated pollution load index (PLI) and sediment quality standard combined with statistical methods were used to assess the degree of pollution, their potential sources and ecosystem risk level. Results : Sites near Shanggukou Bridge and downstream of the intersection of the Le'An and Jishui Rivers had the highest pollution levels of Cu, Zn, Cd and As. In addition to the background areas (BA), both Igeo values and PLI indicated that all the sites were class 4, 5 and 6 types. Upstream areas (UA) and middle stream areas (MA) were considered to be highly polluted. Based on the geochemical partitioning analysis and the ratios between secondary phase and primary phase (RSP) values, the results revealed that higher concentrations of Cu, Pb, Cd and As in the UA and MA were likely to be harmful to the aquatic organisms in these areas. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analyses (HCA) revealed that Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Cr and As were sourced from many complicated anthropogenic sources. Interpretation : Metallic discharges from non-ferrous mine plants and township enterprises contributed the largest portion of sediment pollutants. The visualization technique of Chernoff faces were useful for representing and interpreting the multidimensional data.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Wireless visual sensor networks (WVSNs) are composed of a large number of visual sensor nodes covering a specific geographical region. This paper addresses the target detection problem within WVSNs where visual sensor nodes are left unattended for long-term deployment. As battery energy is a critical issue it is always challenging to maximize the network\u2019s lifetime. In order to reduce energy consumption, nodes undergo cycles of active-sleep periods that save their battery energy by switching sensor nodes ON and OFF, according to predefined duty cycles. Moreover, adaptive compressive sensing is expected to dynamically reduce the size of transmitted data through the wireless channel, saving communication bandwidth and consequently saving energy. This paper derives for the first time an analytical framework for selecting node\u2019s duty cycles and dynamically choosing the appropriate compression rates for the captured images and videos based on their sparsity nature. This reduces energy waste by reaching the maximum compression rate for each dataset without compromising the probability of detection. Experiments were conducted on different standard datasets resembling different scenes; indoor and outdoor, for single and multiple targets detection. Moreover, datasets were chosen with different sparsity levels to investigate the effect of sparsity on the compression rates. Results showed that by selecting duty cycles and dynamically choosing the appropriate compression rates, the desired performance of detection can be achieved with adaptive CS and at the same time saving energy, where the proposed framework results in an 70% on average energy saving as compared to transmitting the captured image without CS.",

In the present study, we developed an in situ-formed hydrogel by crosslinking hydroxypropyl chitosan with alginate dialdehyde. Physical properties of the hydrogel were studied and the cytotoxicity was evaluated using L929 fibroblasts, rabbit corneal endothelial cells and retinal pigment epithelial cells. In a preliminary in vivo study, the hydrogel was employed as vitreous substitute after vitrectomy surgery on rabbits and multiple parameters indicating biosafety and biocompatibility were measured and analyzed postoperatively. Our results showed that the refractive index, transmittance, pH value and density of the hydrogel were similar to those of human vitreous. Cytotoxicity tests demonstrated the hydrogel to be nontoxic to all of the three cell lines selected. Using the rabbit model, we showed that the hydrogel could form in situ and postoperative analysis of slit-lamp observation, intraocular pressure, corneal endothelium examination, B-scan ultrasound and fundus photography showed no significant adverse reactions in the operated eyes during the 90-day follow-up. However, electroretinogram and histopathological examinations indicated minor vision decline and decrease of the densities of cones and rods in the operated rabbit eyes. Collectively, our study suggested that the in situ-formed hydrogel could potentially be used as a vitreous substitute, with its long-term safety and efficacy to be further assessed.

Therefore, we have shown the concept of information sharing system to support vulnerable road users living in the region at Hiroshima city where public transport is not sufficiently developed and created a web service to support their daily life. The role of the proposed system is to facilitate the encounter between local community people, to provide the opportunity of resource sharing, to generate some kinds of transport means, and to support the difficulties in daily life. To make the proposed system effective for solving the issues of vulnerable road users, active participation by young people is essential because most of the resources of skills will be provided by young people. Therefore, in this paper, in order to discuss the continuity of the proposed system as a business, we conducted an attitude survey on young people's awareness of resource sharing at their local community and analyzed it with Quantification Method Type II. The analysis result unveiled a rough trend of the youth consciousness about skill sharing in their local community and also the limitation of Quantification Method Type II.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Nitrogen is crucially limiting in ocean surface waters, and its availability varies substantially with coastal regions typically richer in nutrients than open oceans. In a biological stoichiometry framework, a parsimonious strategy of nitrogen allocation predicts nitrogen content of proteins to be lower in communities adapted to open ocean than to coastal regions. To test this hypothesis we have directly interrogated marine microbial communities, using a series of metagenomics datasets with a broad geographical distribution from the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition. Analyzing over 20 million proteins, we document a ubiquitous signal of nitrogen conservation in open ocean communities, both in membrane and non-membrane proteins. Efficient nitrogen allocation is expected to specifically target proteins that are expressed at high rate in response to nitrogen starvation. Furthermore, in order to preserve protein functional efficiency, economic nitrogen allocation is predicted to target primarily the least functionally constrained regions of proteins. Contrasting the NtcA-induced pathway, typically up-regulated in response to nitrogen starvation, with the arginine anabolic pathway, which is instead up-regulated in response to nitrogen abundance, we show how both these predictions are fulfilled. Using evolutionary rates as an informative proxy of functional constraints, we show that variation in nitrogen allocation between open ocean and coastal communities is primarily localized in the least functionally constrained regions of the genes triggered by NtcA. As expected, such a pattern is not detectable in the genes involved in the arginine anabolic pathway. These results directly link environmental nitrogen availability to different adaptive strategies of genome evolution, and emphasize the relevance of the material costs of evolutionary change in natural ecosystems.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "This chapter presents the historical development, issues, reasons, and consequences of the migration crisis in Slovenia and opens the discussion about what crime prevention education geared toward sustainable development is supposed to achieve and how academic teachers can help students in developing skills that might be needed in order to support a sustainable future in accordance with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4-ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all for the 2016-2030 period. It stresses the importance of education for achieving sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and nonviolence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity, as well as contributions to sustainable development. International organizations, states, and governments promote changes in education and training systems so that these would provide education in the field of sustainable development, including crime prevention. Nevertheless, researchers surmise that these changes remain at the rhetorical level. The European Union's Bologna Process must meet the challenge of intercultural criminological and victimological education for an inclusive, peaceful, and sustainable world. If one wants to advance this goal, it is fundamental to begin with the education and training of qualified academic teachers and teacher educators, who encourage critical thinking and positive action-oriented solutions. Nevertheless, there are already regular migrations of students and university lecturers in the European Union and across the continents, which represent examples of best practice and opportunities for knowledge sharing and extending crime prevention education for sustainable development.",

It brings together research in two related areas of scholarship: academic discourse analysis and literacies research. In this introductory article, we first outline the concept of digital academic discourse as we perceive it in the context of our Special Issue and show how it is related to, and at the same time different from, its \u201canalogue\u201d predecessor. We then continue to discuss the practices surrounding the production of academic texts with the support of digital media, followed by an outline of how both digital academic discourse and related writing practices are tied to the networks, communities and spaces in which they take place. Next, methodological issues in the study of digital academic discourse are considered, and the articles in this special issue are presented in connection to the themes outlined above. We conclude by contextualising the studies reported here within current trends in discourse analytical and sociolinguistic research and identify venues for future studies.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Educational attainment is an important element in the formation of human capital. Although many developing countries have made strong efforts to expand the coverage of education services, children in poor households still struggle to attend school on a regular basis. Human development conditional cash transfers (known as CCTs) have emerged in response to this situation in developing countries. While the effects of the CCTs are well known and widely documented, their effects in relation to educational attainment and school participation are still unclear. This paper looks empirically into the continuous treatment effects of participation length in Familias en Accion, a CCT program in Colombia. The paper focuses on the continuous treatment effects on school registration and educational attainment of participants in the program. Although initial results show a fuzzy relationship between the program outcomes and the participation length, the empirical results confirm the fact that a longer exposure to the antipoverty program led to higher school registration rates, accumulation of years of education, and lower child labor participation levels.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The Jain tradition of ecological awareness and sustainability has been well documented over the last 25 years, although its roots lie deep in Indian history, specifically in texts such as the Tattv\u0101rtha S\u016btra and \u0100c\u0101r\u0101\u1e47ga S\u016btra. This traditional body of knowledge includes a long-standing theory and practice of personal, social and environmental sustainability, addressing such views as the interconnectedness of humans and the laws of nature, the interdependence of everything in the universe, the responsibility of humans to conserve and preserve natural resources, the avoidance of wanton and unnecessary waste generation, and a general aversion to mistreating or abusing the environment. These views encapsulate the lifestyles of some ten million people, including both mendicants and laity. Similarly, Maharishi Vedic Science, the systematic exploration and practical application of the Veda and Vedic Literature as taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, makes a compelling case for establishing the unity of human life with nature and for promoting actions which guarantee both the protection of nature and protection by it. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the principles of sustainability in Jainism and the corresponding viewpoint of Maharishi Vedic Science, including supporting scientific evidence of its application, and to posit their contribution to a sustainable world future.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "South Africa, in relation to other nations on the continent, has the largest number of foreigners, predominantly in its institutions of higher learning. People from all over the world, especially in Asia and other African nations, migrate into the country to acquire skills through formal and informal education. The reason behind this, however, remains unclear. This paper examined what motivates people to come down to South Africa in pursuance of higher learning, with special focus on Nigerian students in the University of Venda. The study draws from UNIVEN and Nigerians because the population of Nigerians currently studying at the University is more than the total population of South Africans studying in all Nigerian higher learning institutions combined, even though Nigeria has been the leading economy in Africa. Despite the frequent xenophobic attacks, there is an annual upsurge in the number of Nigerians who migrate into South Africa. An exploratory sequential research design was used in the study. A census of Nigerian students at the University was taken via emails, guided by a semi-structured questionnaire. Atlas-ti v8, and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 25 were used for the analysis. The analysis of the data showed that there is a general perception that degrees obtained in South Africa are rated higher than those obtained in Nigerian universities by Nigerian government institutions. Some are out to get the recognition and respect accorded those who obtained their degrees abroad. While many were attracted by the flexible education system in terms of supervision and timing, some were interested in international network opportunities, study facilities and funding opportunities. Other factors that emerged are corruption, security and economic stability in South African institution of higher education. Given these results, the study recommended further examination of the nature and typology of higher education systems practiced in both countries for possible recommendations.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "While polycations based on 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate and 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl acrylate are used in applications ranging from biomaterials to wastewater treatment, few studies have considered the remarkable differences in the hydrolytic stabilities of the respective ester groups. Here, we describe how the nature of nonmethyl \u03b1-substituents affect the rates of ester hydrolysis of such polymers, with an emphasis on the resulting shift of net polymer charge from cationic toward anionic. We introduce 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl 2-hydroxymethyl acrylate (DHMA) as a new, very hydrolytically labile, cationic monomer that can be used to form homopolymers as well as a means to tune copolymer hydrolysis. DHMA synthesis and free radical polymerization are described, including reactivity ratios for hydroxyl-protected derivatives of DHMA and 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl acrylate (DMAEA). Hydrolyses of PDHMA, P[DHMA-co-DMAEA], PDMAEA, and PDMAEMA in pH 5 and 7 buffer are reported. The presence of the hydroxymethyl \u03b1-substituent in PDHMA led to rates of hydrolysis 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than the already rapid hydrolysis of PDMAEA. Furthermore, hydrolysis rates of P[DHMA-co-DMAEA] copolymers were shown to increase as the DHMA mole fraction increased. As a result, a new route to adjusting the charge-shifting rates of such polycations in aqueous media is described.",

WHR solutions are usually adopted for the traditional diesel oil applications, while for gas fueled engines are currently under consideration (mainly due to the relatively high investment costs). In order to promote this ecofriendly technology within a marine hybrid propulsion system, it is important to assess the possible improvements in the ship energy efficiency, identifying an appropriate application and analyzing its overall performance level. Compared to traditional diesel oil, the use of the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as fuel allows a better exploitation of the engine exhaust gas energy, resulting into a larger availability of steam for the surplus production of the ship electric energy. In order to evaluate the feasibility of an efficient WHR system in LNG propulsion applications, a numerical code representing the steam powered turbogenerator dynamics is presented. For the proposed case study, simulation results show a good behavior in the most critical electric load variations, confirming the correct sizing of the several WHR system components.",

This study analyzes the changing role of urban planning and the policy of state intervention in land markets to manage spatial changes in Vietnamese cities. Theoretical and empirical approaches are used to analyze urban development and planning practices in Hanoi. The study further describes the constraints of planning systems in hybrid land markets that include both formal and informal land development. We argue that in Vietnam, where the role of the state in market construction has not been fully developed and land market institutions are incomplete, urban planning is used as a passive tool of state control and is no longer relevant to the process of spatial development, which is driven by the speculative activities of interest actors. This situation challenges state regulations for the effective management of spatial resources. The empirical results suggest the utility of further reforms to the land-use system and planning institutions in Vietnam, and of strengthening the capacity of the state in land administration.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Background The HIV-1 epidemic in Ethiopia has been shown to be dominated by two phylogenetically distinct subtype C clades, the Ethiopian (C'-ET) and East African (C-EA) clades, however, little is known about the temporal dynamics of the HIV epidemic with respect to subtypes and distinct clades. Moreover, there is only limited information concerning transmission of HIV-1 drug resistance (TDR) in the country. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among young antiretroviral therapy (ART)-na\u00efve individuals recently diagnosed with HIV infection, in Gondar, Ethiopia, 2011-2013 using the WHO recommended threshold survey. A total of 84 study participants with a median age of 22 years were enrolled. HIV-1 genotyping was performed and investigated for drug resistance in 67 individuals. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on all available HIV sequences obtained from Gondar (n = 301) which were used to define subtype C clades, temporal trends and local transmission clusters. Dating of transmission clusters was performed using BEAST. Result Four of 67 individuals (6.0%) carried a HIV drug resistance mutation strain, all associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Strains of the C-EA clade were most prevalent as we found no evidence of temporal changes during this time period. However, strains of the C-SA clade, prevalent in Southern Africa, have been introduced in Ethiopia, and became more abundant during the study period. The oldest Gondar transmission clusters dated back to 1980 (C-EA), 1983 (C-SA) and 1990 (C'-ET) indicating the presence of strains of different subtype C clades at about the same time point in Gondar. Moreover, some of the larger clusters dated back to the 1980s but transmissions within clusters have been ongoing up till end of the study period. Besides being associated with more sequences and larger clusters, the C-EA clade sequences were also associated with clustering of HIVDR sequences. One cluster was associated with the G190A mutation and showed onward transmissions at high rate. Conclusion TDR was detected in 6.0% of the sequenced samples and confirmed pervious reports that the two subtype C clades, C-EA and C'-ET, are common in Ethiopia. Moreover, the findings indicated an increased diversity in the epidemic as well as differences in transmission clusters sizes of the different clades and association with resistance mutations. These findings provide epidemiological insights not directly available using standard surveillance and may inform the adjustment of public health strategies in HIV prevention in Ethiopia.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Purpose: In an effort to counteract the differences in improvement in survival rates of adolescents and young adults (AYA), compared to other age groups with cancer, the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics established an AYA cancer program. This study was conducted to gather feedback from AYAs in an effort to generate actionable data for program development. Methods: The target population included patients aged 13-31 treated for malignancy in one of the following disease sites: central nervous system, leukemia, lymphoma, neuroendocrine, sarcoma, and thyroid. A series of four focus groups was held to identify and describe gaps in care and provide suggestions for program development. A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was used. Qualitative data were derived from focus group discussion and free-response survey questions, while quantitative data were derived from objective survey questions and electronic medical record data. Results: Across the four focus groups, 24 different AYAs participated, ranging from 8 to 19 individuals per session. Topics discussed included the following: communication, treatment experience, and overall AYA program; finances, work and school, and late effects; relationships, emotions, and spirituality; and body image, infertility, sexuality, risky behavior, and suicide. The results of the analyses corroborated what makes AYAs different from other age groups. The primary theme identified was the unique relationships of AYAs, which can be thought of along a continuum. Conclusions: Information obtained from these analyses has been used to inform specific projects within the development of the AYA program to address patient-identified gaps. For AYAs, the importance of relationships along a continuum should be considered when developing an AYA program, in addition to potential policy or health service research utilization in the future.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Analog-to-digital conversion with high resolution in amplitude has a relatively high energy consumption in communication systems. A promising alternative to reduce the energy consumption is 1-bit quantization. Considering such a receiver, we design and analyze continuous phase modulation (CPM) schemes, which are favorable because of their bandwidth efficiency and their constant envelope. In this context, oversampling with respect to the symbol duration is promising because CPM signals are not strictly bandlimited and because it reduces the loss in achievable rate caused by the quantization. The additional degrees of freedom brought by oversampling can be exploited by higher order modulation schemes. A lower bound on the achievable rate is computed based on an auxiliary channel law. In a further step, we optimize the input distribution with an optimization strategy based on a Markov source model. For a specific example, we give upper bounds on the achievable rate and present a state-machine representation for sequences which are reconstructible at the receiver. Finally, the proposed approach has the advantage of a constant envelope enabling an energy efficient transmitter design while achieving only a slightly lower 90% power containment bandwidth efficiency than existing methods with 1-bit quantization and oversampling.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "While the agency of individuals has been identified as a key factor in triggering governance transformations in social-ecological systems, more research attention is needed on how the social position of the actors involved influences these processes of change. Here, we highlight how the unique position of Indigenous women in a recent fishery conflict brought strength to this resource struggle and led to changes in the management of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. Through 18 semi-structured interviews with Heiltsuk women and men involved in this fishery conflict, we identified important actions taken by women in the community, which contributed to advancing the preconditions for transformation of the existing governance system. Heiltsuk women took on key leadership roles, increasing social cohesion, facilitating the flow of information, and negotiating among those holding power and conflicting objectives. Viewed through the framework of transformative change in social-ecological systems, women demonstrated strategic agency in challenging colonial governance regimes and catalyzing change. We relate these findings to theoretical understandings of women in environmental justice movements and activism and underscore the importance of Indigenous women as agents of change in their communities and as important actors in fisheries governance transformations. These leadership roles must be recognized and supported to navigate towards natural resource sustainability and social justice, globally, as well as reconciliation for past injustices, nationally.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "This study examined the economic and risk effects of conservation agriculture (CA) in western China using nine years of data from an agronomic field experiment and a case study for a typical crop-livestock farm. A CA system of a wheat-pea rotation with no-tillage and stubble retention was compared with the current practice of the same rotation but with conventional tillage and stubble removal. Risk was examined by computing the resistance and resilience of grain yields to climate shocks at the field scale, along with calculating the stability of yields and profits at the field and farm scale. Climate shocks were defined using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index. Resistance indicated the proximity of grain yields during a climate shock to average yields. Resilience indicated the rate of return towards average grain yields after a climate shock. At the field scale, CA increased grain yields by an average of 19.6% and increased profits without negatively affecting resistance or resilience. At the farm scale, CA increased profits by an average of 5%, increased the stability of profits by 33%, and reduced labor demands. Despite these gains, the adoption of CA in western China remains low. Results suggest that at present the private gains to farmers are not large enough to encourage the more widespread adoption of CA. Therefore, because CA also produces public benefits for conservation of the environment such as reduced erosion, financial incentives may be considered to assist CA adoption in specific farming systems.",

However, they face many struggles such as socio-economic and political problems along with flawed policy-making process. Objectives: The current study aimed at presenting a very brief situational analysis of the health policy making and its outcomes in the MICs and accordingly some strategic suggestions to improve this process. Methods: The current brief review study was conducted on the existing evidence on challenges of health policy-making in MICs and its combating solutions. To search literatures, an unlimited time review was conducted in medical databases with predefined keywords. To classify the barriers and their solutions, the current study employed the World Health Organization (WHO) health systems framework; i.e. six building blocks. Results: Reviewing literatures conducted the researchers to the main challenges of health policy-making process in the MICs including poor governance, imperfect health information system, weak resource management, piecemeal plan instead of inclusive national plan, low efficiency, and equitable outcome of their public policies. Conclusions: To improve health policy-making process in MICs, a wide variety of strategies is applicable. These strategies are: (1) Replacing passive problem-solving approach with an active informed-policy making; (2) Preparing a master plan based on sustain-ability and reality, prediction power of the future events, and active participation of all stakeholders; (3) establishing a health system with focus on primary health care, service leveling, referral system, and integrated and quality care; (4) Effective health interventions, reducing corruption, managed use of private beside the public sector, and improvement of their contracting systems, equitable distribution of all resources, and establishing and/or strengthening health technology assessment (HTA) Committee; (5) Reinforcing the role of governance to control health market, community involvement, and mandatory health attachment to all policies.",

A recent review estimates that a minimum of 50% of children in Asia, Africa, and North America experienced severe physical violence by caregivers in the past year, with large variations between countries. Identifying modifiable country-level factors driving these geographic variations has great potential for achieving population-level reductions in rates of child maltreatment. This study builds on previous research by focusing on caregiver-reported physical abuse and neglect victimisation, examining 22 societal factors representing 11 different constructs among 42 countries from 5 continents at different stages of development. Our findings suggest that gender inequity may be important for both child physical abuse and neglect. Indicators of literacy and development may also be important for child neglect. Given the limitations of the correlational findings and measurement issues, it is critical to continue to investigate societal-level factors of child maltreatment so that interventions and prevention efforts can incorporate strategies that have the greatest potential for population-level impact.",

The significance of microbial activities in rivers, lakes, and oceans has been emphasized in the current global climate change scenario. The magnitude of participation of microorganisms to impact worldwide flux of nutrients and greenhouse gas emissions is enormous. Estuarine water and sediments are dominated by bacteria which mineralize or decompose a wide variety of biopolymeric substrates with the aid of hydrolytic extracellular enzymes, produce bioactive compounds, secondary metabolites, antibiotics. Moreover, microbes in estuarine conditions constantly undergo tidal flushing which helps them to adapt to changing salt concentration and this helps to combat osmotic stress and tolerance to broad range of environmental factors like pH, temperature, and salinity in nature. However, in terms of microbial community composition, brackish water ecosystems are poorly understood. The interactions of microbes with biotic and abiotic factors give insights into the larger picture of ecosystem functioning. By using classical culture-dependent and modern culture-independent methods, the microbial diversity of Chilika Lake was evaluated to give insights into their functional and biological role in maintenance of health of estuarine ecosystem for exploiting their future potential.",

However, the government traffic departments are unable to use these valuable traffic data and thus more traffic jam, congestion and road accident occurs. In order to overcome this issue, this paper proposes an effective traffic control system with the help of IoV technology. The proposed method is demonstrated in the study are of Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India. The street maps are segmented into number small number of distinct maps. Ant colony algorithm is applied to each map in order to find the optimal route. In addition, Fuzzy logic based traffic intensity calculation function is proposed in this paper to model the heavy traffic. The proposed IoV based route selection method is compared with the existing shortest path selection algorithms such as Dijikstra algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm. The experimental results proved the good performance of the proposed IoV based route selection method.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "BACKGROUND: With the legalization of medical abortion in Nepal, mifepristone-misoprostol combination via different routes has been widely used for early abortion. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of 200 milligrams mifepristone orally followed by 800 micrograms sublingual misoprostol in outpatient setting. METHODS: It was an open-label prospective study conducted in outpatient department of a tertiary hospital over a period of 13 months. Clients upto nine weeks of pregnancy were enrolled. 200 milligrams of mifepristone orally followed by 800 micrograms of misoprostol sublingually 36 to 48 hours later were prescribed. They were followed up in 14 days sonologically or verbally through telephone. Side effects and satisfaction to the regimen were assessed through acceptability questionnaire. Mann-Whitney U test was used for analyzing categorical data. RESULTS: A total of 47 clients were enrolled. The mean age and gestational age were 29.38 years (SD+5.914) and 6.2 weeks (SD+1.28) respectively. The commonest indications for termination were completed family and unwanted pregnancy (40.4% each). The average duration of bleeding was 5.76 days (SD +3.61). Abdominal cramping was the most common side effect (95.7%). The least acceptable parameter was the bleeding time (80.9%). For 97.9% clients, the adverse effects were acceptable. The overall success rate of the regimen was 87.2%. CONCLUSIONS: With a comparable success rate to vaginal use, home based sublingual use of misoprostol in low resource settings offers an acceptable and cost effective alternative for medical abortion upto nine weeks of pregnancy. Lesser gestational age is a useful predictor for successful abortion.",

In this article, we offer a public health perspective on opportunity youth by describing their distribution in the population and consequences of their disconnection; proposing a conceptual model of the issue based on epidemiological principles, life course development concepts, and ecological theory; and recommending multisector strategies for preventing disconnection of young people and reengaging opportunity youth. A public health approach to the problem of opportunity youth would involve developing and investing in youth monitoring data systems that can be coordinated across multiple sectors, consolidating both the delivery and funding of services for opportunity youth, developing policies and programs that encourage engagement of young people, and fostering systematic approaches to the testing and scaling up of preventive and reengagement interventions.",

Such rocks normally represent very heterogeneous structures. Obtaining representative undisturbed sample of these rocks is cumbersome and the estimation of their geological and geomechanical parameters is, therefore, very challenging. In the literature, such heterogeneous rocks, which are an assortment of rock blocks surrounded by a weaker fine matrix, are called block in matrix rocks (bimrocks). In the present study, the function of fractal dimension, volumetric block proportion (VBP), and largest block size in the bimrock\u2019s deformation modulus are investigated through fabricating large-scale physical specimens and performing laboratory tests. Outcomes of the study revealed that the deformation modulus of physical samples increases with the increase of VBP and the reduction of the fractal dimension. The deformation modulus of physical specimens including coarse aggregate is also more than that of fine aggregates and the difference between them is enhanced with the reduction of the fractal dimension. A new factor called block contact coefficient is introduced to explain the variations in the deformation modulus. Results of the analysis also show that the strength reduction rate in the post-peak region increases with enhancing VBP, and it is less affected by fractal dimension and the largest block size.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Background: Canadians have long been proud of their universal health insurance system, which publicly funds the cost of physician visits and hospitalizations at the point of care. Prescription drugs however, have been subject to a patchwork of public and private coverage which is frequently inefficient and creates access barriers to necessary medicine for many Canadians. Methods: A narrative review was undertaken to understand the important economic, policy and political considerations regarding implementation of universal prescription drug access in Canada (pan-Canadian pharmacare). PubMed, SCOPUS and google scholar were searched for relevant citations. Citation trails were followed for additional information sources. Published books, public reports, press releases, policy papers, government webpages and other forms of gray literature were collected from iterative internet searches to provide a complete view of the current state on this topic. Main findings: Regarding health economics, all five of the reviewed pharmacare simulation models have shown reductions in annual prescription drug expenditure. However, differing policy and cost assumptions have resulted in a wide range of cost-saving estimates between models. In terms of policy, a single-payer, 'first-dollar' coverage model, using a minimum national formulary, is the model most frequently advocated by the academic community, healthcare professions and many public and patient groups. In contrast, a multi-payer, catastrophic 'last-dollar' coverage model, more similar to the current patchwork state of public and private coverage, is preferred by industry drug manufacturers and private health insurance companies. Primary concerns from the detractors of universal, single-payer, 'first-dollar' coverage are the financing required for its implementation and the access barriers that may be created for certain patient populations that are not majorly present in the current public-private payer mix. Conclusion: Canada patiently awaits to see how the issue of prescription drug coverage will be resolved through the work of the Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare. The overarching and ongoing discourse on policy and program implementation may be construed as a political debate informed by divergent public and private interests.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) doped palm oil leaf (Elaeis guineensis/EG) extracts (EG/AgNPs) were prepared as novel, non-toxic, and eco-friendly corrosion inhibitor; which were incorporated in cement composite and examined against reinforcement steel corrosion in natural seawater. Standard corrosion monitoring techniques including linear polarization resistance (LPR), potentiodynamic polarisation, half-cell potential (HCP) and electrical resistivity were used to screen corrosion inhibition potential of EG/AgNPs enabled steel reinforced concrete after exposing them weekly to wet and dry cycles in seawater. Besides, the microstructural, morphological, thermal and elemental properties of such concrete at 365 days of exposure were determined. The microstructures of powder of EG/AgNPs inhibitor, pre- and post-treated concrete (powder and small pieces) as well as the steel reinforcement surface were analysed. Incorporation of 5% green EG/AgNPs inhibitor into the steel reinforced concrete revealed enhanced corrosion resistance, where a protective thin barrier was developed over the steel reinforced surface. This improvement was attributed to the formation of extra calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel in the concrete and thereby blocked the concrete pores. The maximum inhibition efficiency was recorded to be as much as 94.74%. It is established that these green EG/AgNPs has prospective for optimum corrosion inhibiting treatment to achieve durable concrete structures.",

    "title": "Is governmentality the missing link for greening the economic growth?",
    "abstract_cleaned": "The new concept of green growth appears to be an economic growth model, which balances environment sustainability and fostering of economic growth. Yet, much of the green growth research has failed to address the real extent of interconnections and complexity of the relationship between governance and economic, social, and environmental structures. Furthermore, current green growth research tends to focus on the country level, such as the Millennium Development Goals and sustainable development indices, which risks ignoring the additional impacts on micro industrial economies. The lack of connection between green growth and good governance-known as environmental governance-is a crucial gap in practical adoption. Therefore, this study uses Foucault's governmentality lens to view green growth as a technique of government, seeking an environmentally focused eco-governmentality. We examine the transformation, differential definitions, and critical dimensions of green growth in relation to particular case studies taken from China and South Korea and frame them for future sustainable studies. The findings of this study highlight the significant role of interdisciplinary research, as well both bottom-up and top-down initiatives, on enabling the transition to green growth. The proposed research framework and implementation strategy also identifies new avenues for future research and practices in the field of sustainable development, making it one of the study's key contributions to the literature.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Global citizenship education (GCE) has been elevated by the UN to form both part of its Sustainable Development Goals for education and the central tenet in its Preventing Violent Extremism through Education (PVE-E) strategy. I argue that GCE has no chance of playing a role in counterterrorism unless it embraces a decolonial approach to cognitive justice. The paper provides a descriptive account of the politics of GCE and its take-up by the UN and UNESCO, including an account of postcolonial and decolonial approaches to GCE. The paper conducts an interpretive discourse analysis of textual data around UNESCO's approach to GCE and PVE-E to assess how, if at all, history and historical literacy is addressed. Through this analysis, combined with interview data, previous ethnographic experience, and secondary literature in the field of terrorism studies and political violence, the paper concludes by making a case for the inclusion of historical literacy in education designed to promote peace, justice, and global citizenship. The paper makes no na\u00efve claims about GCE as a panacea for political violence; rather it suggests that if there is any hope of it performing the function that UNESCO ascribes to it, it will only be through the inclusion of cognitive justice.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "AIM To investigate the main current etiologies of cirrhosis in Mexico. METHODS We performed a cross-sectional retrospective multicenter study that included eight hospitals in different areas of Mexico. These hospitals provide health care to people of diverse social classes. The inclusion criteria were a histological, clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, or imaging diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. Data were obtained during a 5-year period (January 2012-December 2017). RESULTS A total of 1210 patients were included. The mean age was 62.5 years (SD = 12.1), and the percentages of men and women were similar (52.0% vs 48.0%). The most frequent causes of liver cirrhosis were hepatitis C virus (HCV) (36.2%), alcoholic liver disease (ALD) (31.2%), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (23.2%), and the least frequent were hepatitis B virus (1.1%), autoimmune disorders (7.3%), and other conditions (1.0%). CONCLUSION HCV and ALD are the most frequent causes of cirrhosis in Mexico. However, we note that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as an etiology of cirrhosis increased by 100% compared with the rate noted previously. We conclude that NAFLD will soon become one of the most frequent etiologies of liver cirrhosis in Mexico.",

Drainage ditches were closed across 480 ha to enhance the water supply of the moist forests during the growing season. The resulting increase in water availability is expected to boost the carbon storage potential in the area. Already, the oak-hornbeam forests store 322 t of carbon per ha. More than 3 400 trees were safeguarded against silvicultural exploitation on a long-term basis to promote forest biodiversity. Comparative studies in managed and unmanaged forest reserves revealed the high value of mixed deciduous forests for biodiversity, notably for saproxylic beetle and bird species.

    "abstract_cleaned": "With increased urbanization, ecological challenges such as climate change and loss of biodiversity, and stress-related disorders globally posing a major threat to public health and wellbeing, the development of efficient multiple-use strategies for urban green spaces and infrastructures is of great importance. In addition to benefits such as climate and water regulation, food production, and biodiversity conservation, green spaces and features have been associated with various health and wellbeing outcomes from a psychological perspective. Research suggests links between exposure to green environmental qualities and restoration from psycho-physiological stress and attention fatigue, promotion of physical activity, increased neighborhood satisfaction and even reduced mortality. Especially strong associations have been observed in urban and socio-economically challenged areas. Usually such salutogenic, i.e., health-promoting, effects are explained through theories related to the notion of biophilia, i.e., the idea that humans share innate tendencies to attend to natural environments and features that have been beneficial during evolution. This paper assumes an ecological approach to perception and behavior to be fruitful in order to analyze the salutogenic potential of environments such as urban green spaces and to step beyond the green vs. gray dichotomy that has been prevalent through much of the research on health-promoting environments. Through an analysis of environmental affordances for certain perceived qualities such an approach is explored through a proposed concept for urban green space use and management, the edible forest garden. Such gardens, based on agroecological principles, have emerged as one of the most promising models regarding ecologically sustainable food production. In addition to potential contributions of importance for urban sustainability and biodiversity, we argue that the inclusion of edible forest gardens in urban green spaces - today globally dominated by lawns - also potentially could reinforce several affordances of salutogenic importance, both in terms of, e.g., social cohesion but also in regard to restoration from psycho-physiological stress and attention fatigue. Increased opportunities for contact with nature and processes of food production may also reinforce pro-environmental behaviors in the population and thus also affect long-term sustainability.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "In 2009, Germany ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) and committed itself to allow for \u201cthe full and effective participation [of people with disabilities] in society\u201d (United Nations, 2006, \u00a73), especially in education (United Nations, 2016, \u00a724). The present article addresses the necessary follow-up question: which patterns of perception university teachers have of students with disabilities? A first project-based qualitative analysis of data from the EU-project \u201cEuropean Action on Disability within Higher Education\u201d has been conducted on the grounds that disability can be described as a constructed sociocultural phenomenon (Tremain, 2005), showing that heterogenous concepts of disability can be reconstructed from the interviews (Aust, Trommler, & Drinck, 2015). In an adaptation of theoretical sampling according to Grounded Theory (Glaser & Strauss, 2010), interviews with teachers were selected for this article. The Explanatory Legitimacy Theory Model by DePoy and Gilson (2004, 2010) served as a pool of ideas for analysis. The four main areas of, 1) effective power of symbols or iconic figures, 2) performativity of attributions of disability, 3) dimension of time for concepts addressed, and 4) perpetuation of the medicine model can be reconstructed. The analysis indicates that the medicine model remains the dominant reference when teachers in higher education speak about disability. In conclusion, conditions that impede the proper implementation of the UN-CRPD in higher education must be identified so that higher education institutions can be further developed as multicultural organisations (Schein, 1984).",

The city-fortress, founded in 1743, was designed on the basis of the new principles of urban planning and architecture laid by Emperor Peter I, which causes a keen interest. To date, several architectural monuments of the city of the period, related to the style of the Petrine Baroque, are lost. Since this style is represented by a few architectural structures, their study is of particular interest in the context of the history of Russian architecture. The architectural appearance of the first major temples of the city - the Cathedral of the Transfiguration of the Lord and the Vvedensky Cathedral - is captured by artists and photographers. The search and detailed study of these iconographic materials form part of the retrospective method of reconstructing the cathedrals and constructing its orthogonal projections.

This means that good sexual health is measured not just by absence of disease, but through a person\u2019s capacity to pursue a safe and pleasurable sexual life that contributes to their overall well-being. This definition aligns with an increasing body of international research that shows that the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among women is strongly associated with structural, social, and cultural factors. Women who are most vulnerable to HIV or STIs are those who have less agency over their sexuality and sexual relationships or more limited access to education and clinical care. In this way, sexual health is a product of the social environment and the day-to-day realities of women\u2019s lives.

Therapeutic hypothermia is associated with physiological cellular changes in the ischemic myocardium, and a trend towards improved hemodynamics in patients with AMI and cardiogenic shock, but is currently not considered to be a therapeutic modality. A case is presented that supports the role of therapeutic hypothermia as salvage therapy in patients with cardiogenic shock following AMI. Case Report: A 37-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest following an anterior wall AMI due to occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery complicated by cardiogenic shock, underwent emergent percutaneous revascularization with placement of a stent, a percutaneous left ventricular-assist device (LVAD), and a pulmonary artery catheter. Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated to achieve a target core body temperature of between 32\u201334\u00b0C for 24 hours, followed by slow re-warming. However, after rewarming, the patient developed refractory cardiogenic shock, despite revascularization, pharmacological and mechanical circulatory support. A second cycle of therapeutic hypothermia was initiated as salvage therapy, leading to clinical improvement. The patient had a favorable outcome, was discharged from hospital and was able to return to work. Conclusions: The first successful case is described in which therapeutic hypothermia was re-initiated as salvage therapy for cardiogenic shock where no other hemodynamic support resources were available.",

In this paper we focus on PayTM, a digital wallet, and a specific set of users of PayTM, street vendors in urban India. Through an ethnographic investigation we offer to unpack two questions: 1. Can digital forms of money create financial inclusion by opening up access to the marginalized 2. Can digital platforms amplify socio-economic capacities of low literate users enhancing financial literacy? We argue that digital and financial literacy are an immersive component of digital wallet use acquiring &#x2018;everyday life&#x2019; in specific socio-economic ecosystems. Our study captures daily practices of digital money staking a claim in advancing the understanding of financial inclusion as a lived process accumulating habits, practices and stakes to expand socio-economic capabilities.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The purpose of this article is to compare sludge management trends between selected EU-15 and EU-12 countries on the basis of statistical data to determine trends and formulate conclusions for countries adopted after 2004. The analysis relied on the analysis of changes in legal regulations, international literature and the analysis of statistical data from EUROSTAT. Unfortunately, incomplete statistical data limited the number of analyzed countries, however, it was possible to draw conclusions. Sludge management is an extremely complex issue, affects not only water and sewage management and waste management, but also concerns the issues of agriculture (fertilizers) and energy. A very important part of the issues is technological progress, and therefore research and development. Improper management of sewage sludge will in the long run lead to increasing costs of wastewater treatment, while modern technologies allow for the recovery of both energy and raw materials. The law in principle ruled out the possibility of storage and limited the agricultural use of unprocessed sewage sludge, thus one should choose the optimal development directions of the sector. Possible areas of action are burning with recovery of energy and raw materials from ashes or organic recycling, i.e. composting with recovery of energy and heat and using the resulting fertilizer.",

Water quality in an industry is done by maintaining the pH of the water which is used for the different processes in the industry. The effluents constantly undergo changes because of several reasons such as variation in water chemistry due to seasonal changes, varying plant operating conditions and other factors. An industrial networked control system (INCS) is one of the upcoming technologies, where the data can be transferred from one medium of place to any location. Here various control techniques are implemented to identify the optimized controller which would help the process to work smoothly. In this paper, the pH process is checked under the networked environment using different controllers such as IMC based PID controller, Direct Synthesis PID controller, CDM based controller, Model Predictive Controller (MPC).",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The current Egyptian situation is framed by land and water scarcity, which are under severe pressure. The Nile Delta is one of the most densely populated deltas in the world. Soil and water resources are at the center of sustainable development and are critical for socio-economic development. Nile Delta branches gain water from the aquifer in some reaches and lose water to the aquifer in other reaches. The flow directions between groundwater and surface water can change seasonally with variations of the water table level with respect to the level in nearby waterways. Available data on the evolution of the salinity of groundwater in the Delta indicate that the construction of the High Aswan dam resulted in a shift of salinity isolines towards the seashore, and that current pumping rates have not yet critically affected this balance. Possible localized over-pumping, however, results in \u201cup-coning\u201d of salinity from deeper layers. Contamination of groundwater by agriculture and more prominently by seepage from domestic and industrial effluents had already attained worrying levels. This may jeopardize the quality of the Nile Delta aquifer in the end. The increasing use of groundwater for irrigation poses a serious threat to food security and could lead to unaffordable prices of staple foods. Therefore, groundwater overuse rising could hit food prices. Aquifer depletion can induce significant environmental degradation, such as land subsidence and seawater intrusion. The amount of non-renewable groundwater used for irrigation was doubled in Nile Valley and Delta. The annual groundwater abstraction in the Nile aquifer system and fringes is about 4.6 billion m3. Another 0.5 billion m3 is abstracted from the desert aquifers and the coastal areas. Groundwater abstraction is expected to increase to 11.4 billion m3. Model output revealed that groundwater recharge has not changed significantly over time, while pumping has. Because of these trends, groundwater was estimated to be in a deficit of approximately 24 billion m3 (\u00b115%) in year 2011, compared to year 1957. Most of the Nile Delta soils are recent alluvial soils. The soils generally have a light to heavy clay texture. The clay content varies from 40% in the south to nearly 70% in the north. The soils located near the north coast and lakes are of marine and alluvial deposits. Close to the desert fringe on both sides of the Delta occurs the desert sandy plains, which are flat to undulating topography. The soils of the coastal plains and beaches are sandy with some low to medium longitudinal sand dunes. The salinity problem becomes more severe in the Delta as we approach the seacoast and lakes, due to the effect of the shallow, saline groundwater and the brackish water intrusion from the sea and lake. The old and young terraces of both western and eastern sides of the Nile Delta are of alluvial origin and non-uniform in nature. Most of the soils are originated from the ancient Nile sediments, which are mostly derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks of the Abyssinian Plateau. The soils are alluvial deposits of the Nile Delta (Qatabeya) and valley (Qena), swamps and fluviomarine-lacustrine deposits (El-Manzala), beach sands (Edku). The old alluvial soil is more developed than other soils.",

In this paper, the multicast beamforming algorithm based on the group user CSI is proposed to improve the energy efficiency of the system. Multi-user beamforming technology can improve the energy efficiency of BSs in group scenarios of broadband Trunking system, and guarantee the QoS of group users. The two optimization problems are both NP-hard. The paper adopts SDR, dropping some constraints in the original optimization problem, transform the original optimization problem into SDP to achieve the approximation solution. The improved algorithm guarantees the QoS of the group users by changing the priority of the user.

The objective of the paper is to present a comprehensive review covering the various technical and conceptual aspects of efficient power management at home front. A systematic review proposed by several researchers till date in this area is considered. The study focuses on the concepts, technical background, architecture and infrastructure along with various schemes as well as goals including various issues and challenges faced with HEMS systems. The research paper proposes a novel methodology for improvising the home design architecture by incorporating the concept of green building in order to reduce the energy consumption done by a resident at their home front. The concept of HEM systems or SHEMS is not just about proposing new models to save energy, power management, or making energy efficient appliances to be used at home front but also about creating awareness among the consumers and motivating them to participate in the activities related to power conservation in active manner. The study have shown the, impact of various schemes over the peak load reduction with Optimization based residential energy management (OREM) technique showing the reduction in power consumption showing a cut down of about 35% in the overall electricity bill.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) marine systems represent a valid solution for the ship energy efficiency improvement, especially in Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) propulsion applications. Compared to traditional diesel fuel oil, a better thermal power can be recovered from the exhaust gas produced by a LNG-fueled engine. Therefore, steam surplus production may be used to feed a turbogenerator in order to increase the ship electric energy availability without additional fuel consumption. However, a correct design procedure of the WHR steam plant is fundamental for proper feasibility analysis, and from this point of view, numerical simulation techniques can be a very powerful tool. In this work, the WHR steam plant modeling is presented paying attention to the simulation approach developed for the steam turbine and its governor dynamics. Starting from a nonlinear system representing the whole dynamic behavior, the turbogenerator model is linearized to carry out a proper synthesis analysis of the controller, in order to comply with specific performance requirements of the power grid. For the considered case study, simulation results confirm the validity of the developed approach, aimed to test the correct design of the whole system in proper working dynamic conditions.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)Current environmental policies, which promote a more sustainable food sector, have boosted efforts to reduce energy demand during processing, and particularly during drying operations. One of the routes towards more sustainable and efficient drying processes is the design and implementation of optimal operational routines for the existing drying equipment. In the food industry, drum-dryers are typically employed for the production of food powders from viscous slurries (e.g. starchy slurries). Food powders are used in a wide range of applications in the food industry, from beverage powders (milk or cocoa), instant soups, spices or flours and flavours. In this framework, we propose a model-based optimisation routine for the operation of a double drum-dryer (product under atmospheric conditions) used in the manufacture of a breakfast cereal porridge. The problem defines optimal steam temperature and optimal rotation speed that minimises the energy demand of the dryer operation for a range of operating conditions that considered different: product formulation, final moisture contents, thickness and initial temperature of the wet slurry. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of model-based approaches to the design and optimisation of more sustainable and efficient industrial drying technologies in the food sector, which can help in the achievement of short/medium-term energy reduction goals.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "Copyright The environmental problem related to urban solid waste generation and management requires alternatives that enable communities to have appropriate collection, transport and disposal methods for urban solid waste. Likewise, it is necessary to develop alternative uses as many of the materials generated can be reused or recycled. Plastic waste is among the types of waste most generated by communities, making up approximately 11 % of waste in middle income countries, some of which possess high commercial value and is easy to recover and recycle, while others are more complicated due to their volume-to-weight ratio. This is the case of expanded polystyrene, which has a low commercial value and few reuse alternatives, making it an unattractive type of waste for the recycling chain, and as a result, while being 100 % recyclable, it still ends up in municipal landfills. In order to facilitate the use of this waste, this paper presents a stress-strain curve analysis for the mixture of expanded polystyrene (EPS) and polypropylene (PP), both recovered wastes, for the purpose of contributing to the physical-mechanical characterization of this mixture to develop future research projects to reincorporate this material in the recycling chain.",

Analysis of land subsidence with high temporal-spatial resolution is necessary and can help to assess the risk of geohazards. In this study, we apply the SBAS-InSAR technique to monitor the land subsidence in Fuzhou downtown after the program of metro construction. 24 scenes of X-band TerraSAR data from July 2013 to August 2015 and 32 scenes of C-band Sentinel-1 data from July 2015 to February 2018 were used in this experiment. Our results show a maximum subsidence rate of -12mm/yr, and eight subsidence funnels have been found during the observed period. After analyzing the subsidence of these regions in a long time span, it can be concluded that there are three regions which have a relatively stable disastrous subsidence effect, and there is a possibility of further intensified subsidence.",

An understanding of the population density and pattern of distribution will help planners understand the pattern of urban development and urban dwelling trends. Population density and its distribution can be seen through the trend of population density based on the distance of the sub-district center to the city center. Usually, the population density will be high in the city center and will decrease to the suburbs. The research was conducted in 15 cities across Indonesia spread across several main islands of Indonesia and with a diverse population such as geographical area and geographical conditions. Results show that the densest population will be in the center of the city as an economic area, and its density decreases as it progresses further from downtown. This indicates that the population density will rise if it is close to the location of economic activity i.e. downtown, and will decrease when away from the city center.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The clostridia are a diverse group of bacteria that have a rich history in medical microbiology and biotechnology. Although clostridial diseases such as tetanus \u2018lockjaw\u2019 were mentioned by Hippocrates and in ancient medical literature, clostridia were first definitively discovered by Pasteur in his seminal studies of fermentations. The genus Clostridium consists of rod-shaped, obligately anaerobic, spore-forming bacteria. The formation of dormant endospores by the clostridia enables them to resist extreme environmental conditions including heat, radiation, and chemical stresses, and this resistance contributes to their wide distribution in nature. The study of the clostridia has had important impacts on many aspects of basic and applied microbiology particularly in human and animal diseases and in industrial fermentations. Certain species including Clostridium botulinum, C. tetani, and C. sordellii produce the most poisonous toxins known to humankind. The clostridia hold notoriety for their involvement in several vivid diseases of humans and animals. These include the striking paralytic syndromes of botulism, tetanus or lockjaw, gas gangrene and other wound infections, and blackleg in animals. In recent years, C. difficile has been recognized as the most prevalent pathogen of antibiotic-mediated diarrhea and toxic megacolon in hospital and healthcare environments. Protein toxins and enzymes are the primary virulence factors that contribute to these diseases. The discovery of protein toxins led to the development of vaccines as immunotherapies that revolutionized the prevention of a diversity of diseases. The clostridia also have industrial importance in food spoilage and are a valuable source of enzymes used in bioprocessing and in biotransformations. Clostridia are important in fermentation processes for the production of solvents and organic acids, exemplified by the Weizmann process for the production of acetone for the preparation of munitions during World War II. Remarkably, during the past 30 years, botulinum neurotoxin has been developed for therapeutic treatment of more than 100 neurological disorders, including dystonias, involuntary muscle disorders, pain, spasticity, and other maladies, as well as for cosmetic purposes.",

Spillages and accidental leakages are frequent during the extraction, refinement, transportation, and hoarding of oil and their products. The living beings on earth are foremostly contaminated by hazardous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); therefore, their degradation is essential. The inadequate use of chemical and mechanical techniques to expel hydrocarbons from the sullied marine ecosystem is not cost-effective. The conversion of complex natural contaminants to other simple natural substances by biodegraders such as microorganisms may allude to absolute mineralization into carbon dioxide, water, and inorganic substances through the mechanism of bioremediation. Previous research works on PAH-degrading bacteria are mainly focused on the utilization of terrestrial microbes; however, the potential use of marine microbes is unexplored. There is an enduring international interest in exploring the application of microbes isolated from marine sponge Biemna fortis having high PAH-degrading potential. This book chapter represents an updated overview of the potential application of microbes isolated from marine sponge B. fortis for PAH degradation.",

Such volatility imperils coastal and riverine populations, degrades agriculture, and fosters water insecurity. We require innovative, multidimensional solutions to these public works challenges. Infrastructural ecology is a planning paradigm that emulates the closed-loop, sharing logic of natural ecosystems. It suggests that features of our power, water, sanitation, transport, and food systems may be strategically combined, collocated, or otherwise linked for mutual benefit. Such interconnected systems then can cascade (pass along) waste energy or water and nutrients for another\u2019s reuse, arrangements that can reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, while lowering demand for new resource inputs. Innovative examples from both industrialized as well as developing nations illustrate the efficacy of these strategies.

    "abstract_cleaned": "Addressing the water energy cooling environment nexus in an integrated and proactive way is an insistent motivation for research, development, and innovation. This combination is highly valued as renewable energy is used to drive plants to produce electrical power, provide cooling or heating, and extract clean water. Such plants significantly reduce the greenhouse gases and air pollutant emissions generated by combustion of fossil fuels. Adsorption-based desalination (AD) system has been proposed to produce both fresh/potable water and cooling effect for rural and remote coastal communities. The system is powered by low-grade heat or solar energy. Desalination feature has been added to adsorption cooling system to distinguish it and improve its performance. However, the performance of this hybrid system is still relatively low comparing to the other cooling and desalination technologies. Accordingly, the AD systems are being evolved steadily over the past decades to enhance their performance. In this chapter, the working principle of the AD cycle is demonstrated, and the characteristics of the recommended working pairs are discussed. Productivity progress of different arrangements of AD plant in terms of specific daily water production (SDWP) is presented in chronological order. The effect of the operating conditions and the system cycle time on the system performance is shown. Predicting the technology performance is also exhibited. Until now, the cycle could produce a SDWP up to 25 kg/kg of adsorbent per day. Moreover, this work summarizes the improvement that has been achieved in the last decades and the trend of this technology in the near future.",

    "abstract_cleaned": "The extent and diversity of Himalayan forests are well known, and evidence suggests these forests differ significantly from both tropical and temperate forests of the world. These forests are vulnerable to various perturbations (anthropogenic and natural). However, the extent of sensitivity for diverse forests is not known. Therefore, all forests are being treated equally for their conservation and management needs. Considering this, a repeat survey (conducted during 2010-2014) of some earlier studied (1988-1990) representative forest communities in part of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (west Himalaya) provides evidence of importance level and change sensitivity of diverse forest communities. Various composition-based community indices, i.e., Community Importance Index (CII), Community Change Sensitivity (CSS), Community Threat Index (CTI), and Community Integrity (CI) score, were developed to signify importance of each forest community for conservation and management. Two most important communities that maintain compositional integrity in the region include Mixed Silver fir-Rhododendron-Maple (CII-90) and Quercus floribunda (CII-83) community. The Community Change Sensitivity (CCS) highlighted Q. floribunda (46) and A. pindrow (41) communities as most change sensitive, whereas Mixed Oak deciduous (CTI-93) and Q. floribunda (CTI-84) communities exhibited maximum threats of change. The overall scenarios of communities considering various priorities have been defined. Analysis of priorities, thus defined, suggests that different scenarios can be used for building strategies and management prescriptions depending upon the management objectives. The scenarios discussed herein are meant for (i) ensuring conservation of maximum plant diversity of the reserve by way of using CII, (ii) planning to accommodate the potential changes in community structure (i.e., shift in vegetation/species boundaries and/or change in dominance of forests, etc.) by building on CCS ranking, (iii) addressing the threats of non-native species proliferation through use of CTI, and (iv) defining community stability and resilience in a more holistic way using Community Integrity (CI) scores. The study for the first time provides diverse scenarios of management in regional forests.",

On the other hand, managed matrixes with greater agricultural biodiversity and reduced synthetic inputs tend to favor species' persistence. There is discord regarding the best model to conserve biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, but the land sharing system increases the landscape heterogeneity, ensures food production, and constitutes a safer approach from the socioecological perspective. Future studies should consider the matrix identity and management to assess fragmentation effects and its ability to harbor biodiversity.",

This is, of course, very much needed. However, besides other functions and roles, business ethics should also be a critical enterprise, that is, it should not become apologetic to mainstream business in order to live up to the challenges of today\u2019s ecological crisis. This implies a critical reflection on current management practices as well as questioning the basic assumptions and theoretical constructions of management studies, including the CSR paradigm and business ethics. By undertaking a critical approach, the chapter focuses on the problem of moral motivations: why be ethical. The chapter argues that the \u2018why\u2019 should precede the \u2018how\u2019 question and that the institutional context of today\u2019s global business makes ethical motivations increasingly difficult to prevail over the profit motives. This implies that the limits of business ethics should also be acknowledged: addressing some fundamental social and environmental problems associated with mainstream business may need effective legal, institutional and political solutions beyond the ethical approach. Leadership in business ethics should mean contributing to a new business paradigm in which the rules of the game are not in sharp contradiction with basic moral requirements and which provides support for the sustainability transformation humankind must undertake.",

    "title": "Sociodemographic characteristic of changes in smoking patterns in rural and urban population of PURE Poland study: Findings from 6-year follow up",
    "abstract_cleaned": "Background: Tobacco smoking is one of the most serious modern civilization threats. According to WHO identifying patterns of tobacco use is essential for implementing effective preventive policies. The aim of the paper was to assess changes in smoking patterns among the PURE study population over 6 years. Methods: The study sample comprised of 1784 adult participants from PURE Poland study, who were assessed at baseline (2007-2010) and then at 6-year follow-up. Participants were classified into current smokers, ex-smokers and never smokers. Smoking patterns were analyzed according to sex, age/birth cohort, place of residence (urban vs rural setting), and education level. Results: Overall, a significant decrease of 3.1% in current smokers was observed (from 20.0% in baseline to 16.9 at follow-up). However, 0.8% of never smokers and 6.2% of ex-smokers at baseline were classified as current smokers at 6-year follow-up. Despite overall decrease in percentage of current smokers in both rural and urban area, in fact significantly more ex-smokers from rural area became current smokers after 6 years. Living in the rural area was associated with nearly two-fold increase in current smoking, and almost two-fold decline in chances to quit smoking. The highest percentage of current smokers was observed in birth year cohort 1961-1979. Conclusion: Despite a small but significant decline in overall smoking rates, important differences in smoking and quitting patterns emerged between rural and urban areas, as well as sexes. A less favorable smoking patterns were observed among women, and rural populations, suggesting that these are important targets of future tobacco control interventions in Poland.",
